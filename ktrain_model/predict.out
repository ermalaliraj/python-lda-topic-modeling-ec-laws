In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent
divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal
certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide natural
persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors,
to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as
effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal market
requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the
protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account of the specific situation of micro,
small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard
to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies, and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged
to take account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation.
The notion of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC
