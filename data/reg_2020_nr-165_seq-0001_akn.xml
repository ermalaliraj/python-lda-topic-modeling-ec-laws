               <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sharp drop in air traffic as a result of a significant reduction in the demand for transport and the adoption by Member States and third countries of direct measures such as border closing and air traffic bans to contain the pandemic.</p>

               <p>Figures published by Eurocontrol, which is the network manager for the air traffic network functions of the single European sky, indicate a fall in air traffic of around 90 % for the European region at the end of March 2020, as compared to March 2019. Air carriers are reporting large reductions in forward bookings as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are cancelling flights for the winter 2019&#45;2020 and summer 2020 scheduling periods. The sudden drop in demand and the unprecedented rate of cancellations has led to severe liquidity problems for air carriers. Those liquidity problems are directly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

               <p>Union air carriers, which were financially healthy before the COVID-19 pandemic, face liquidity problems that could trigger the suspension or revocation of their operating licence, or its replacement by a temporary licence, without there being a structural economic need for this to occur.

                  </authorialNote> could send a negative signal to the market about the ability of an air carrier to survive, which in turn would aggravate any, otherwise temporary, financial problems. On the basis of the assessment carried out over the period from 1 March 2020 to 31 December 2020, it is therefore appropriate, provided that safety is not at risk and that there is a realistic prospect of a satisfactory financial reconstruction within 12 months, that the operating licence of such air carriers is not suspended or revoked. At the end of this 12‚Äêmonth period, the Union air carrier should be subject to the procedure laid down in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008. The obligation provided in Article 9(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 to inform the Commission should also apply to decisions not to suspend or revoke the operating licence.</p>

In such circumstances, it is appropriate for the managing body of the airport to be able to choose a groundhandling service provider directly to provide the services for a maximum period of six months. It should be recalled that, where the managing body of the airport needs to procure groundhandling services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and is a contracting entity within the meaning of Article 4 of Directive 2014/25/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">
