               <p>In the context of a procedure for the authorisation of the use of a plant protection product containing the active substance bentazone on peas with pods, an application was submitted in accordance with Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 for modification of the existing MRL.</p>

               <p>The Authority concluded that all requirements with respect to data were met and that the modification to the MRL requested by the applicant was acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups. The Authority took into account the most recent information on the toxicological properties of the substance. Neither the lifetime exposure to the substance via consumption of all food products that may contain it, nor the short-term exposure due to high consumption of peas with pods showed that there is a risk that the acceptable daily intake or the acute reference dose is exceeded.</p>
