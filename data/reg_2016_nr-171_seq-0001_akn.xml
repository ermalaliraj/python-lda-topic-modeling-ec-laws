               <p>The pricing of many financial instruments and financial contracts depends on the accuracy and integrity of benchmarks. Serious cases of manipulation of interest rate benchmarks such as LIBOR and EURIBOR, as well as allegations that energy, oil and foreign exchange benchmarks have been manipulated, demonstrate that benchmarks can be subject to conflicts of interest. The use of discretion, and weak governance regimes, increase the vulnerability of benchmarks to manipulation. Failures in, or doubts about, the accuracy and integrity of indices used as benchmarks can undermine market confidence, cause losses to consumers and investors and distort the real economy. It is therefore necessary to ensure the accuracy, robustness and integrity of benchmarks and of the benchmark determination process.</p>

               <p>Benchmarks are vital in pricing cross-border transactions, thereby facilitating the effective functioning of the internal market in a wide variety of financial instruments and services. Many benchmarks used as reference rates in financial contracts, in particular mortgages, are provided in one Member State but used by credit institutions and consumers in other Member States. In addition, such credit institutions often hedge their risks or obtain funding for granting those financial contracts in the cross-border interbank market. Only a few Member States have adopted national rules on benchmarks, but their respective legal frameworks on benchmarks already show divergences regarding aspects such as the scope of application. In addition, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) agreed principles on financial benchmarks on 17 July 2013 (&apos;IOSCO principles for financial benchmarks&apos;), Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies on 5 October 2012 (&apos;IOSCO principles for PRAs&apos;) (together, &apos;the IOSCO principles&apos;), and since those principles provide a certain flexibility as to their exact scope and means of implementation, Member States are likely to adopt rules at national level which would implement such principles in a divergent manner.</p>

               <p>Those divergent approaches would result in fragmentation of the internal market since administrators and users of benchmarks would be subject to different rules in different Member States. Thus, benchmarks provided in one Member State could be prevented from being used in other Member States. In the absence of a harmonised framework to ensure the accuracy and integrity of benchmarks used in financial instruments and financial contracts, or in order to measure the performance of investment funds, in the Union it is therefore likely that differences in Member States&apos; laws will create obstacles to the smooth functioning of the internal market for the provision of benchmarks.</p>

               <p>Union consumer protection rules do not cover the particular issue of adequate information on benchmarks in financial contracts. As a result of consumer complaints and litigation relating to the use of benchmarks in several Member States, it is likely that divergent measures, inspired by legitimate concerns of consumer protection, would be adopted at national level, which could result in fragmentation of the internal market due to the divergent conditions of competition attached to different levels of consumer protection.</p>

               <p>Therefore, in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and improve the conditions of its functioning, in particular with regard to financial markets, and to ensure a high level of consumer and investor protection, it is appropriate to lay down a regulatory framework for benchmarks at Union level.</p>

               <p>It is appropriate and necessary for that framework to take the form of a regulation in order to ensure that provisions directly imposing obligations on persons involved in the provision, contribution and use of benchmarks are applied in a uniform manner throughout the Union. Since a legal framework for the provision of benchmarks necessarily involves measures specifying precise requirements concerning aspects inherent to such provision of benchmarks, even small divergences on the approach taken regarding one of those aspects could lead to significant impediments in the cross-border provision of benchmarks. Therefore, the use of a regulation, which is directly applicable, should reduce the possibility of divergent measures being taken at national level, and should ensure a consistent approach and greater legal certainty, and prevent the appearance of significant impediments in the cross-border provision of benchmarks.</p>

               <p>The scope of this Regulation should be as broad as necessary to create a preventive regulatory framework. The provision of benchmarks involves discretion in their determination and is inherently subject to certain types of conflicts of interest, which implies the existence of opportunities and incentives to manipulate benchmarks. Such risk factors are common to all benchmarks and should be made subject to adequate governance and control requirements. The degree of risk, however, varies, and the approach adopted should therefore be tailored to the particular circumstances. Since the vulnerability and importance of a benchmark varies over time, restricting the scope by reference to indices that are currently important or vulnerable would not address the risks that any benchmark poses in the future. In particular, benchmarks that are currently not widely used could be used more in the future with the result that, in their regard, even a minor manipulation could have a significant impact.</p>

               <p>The critical determinant of the scope of this Regulation should be whether the output value of the benchmark determines the value of a financial instrument or a financial contract, or measures the performance of an investment fund. Therefore, the scope should not be dependent on the nature of the input data. Benchmarks calculated from economic input data, such as share prices and non-economic numbers, or values such as weather parameters should thus be included. The framework provided for in this Regulation should also acknowledge the existence of a large number of benchmarks and the different impact that they have on financial stability and the real economy. This Regulation should also provide for a proportionate response to the risks that different benchmarks pose. This Regulation should therefore cover benchmarks which are used to price financial instruments listed or traded on regulated venues.</p>

               <p>Many investment indices involve significant conflicts of interest and are used to measure the performance of a fund such as a UCITS fund. Some of those benchmarks are published and others are made available, for free or upon payment of a fee, to the public or a section of the public and their manipulation can adversely affect investors. This Regulation should therefore cover indices or reference rates that are used to measure the performance of an investment fund.</p>

               <p>All contributors of input data to benchmarks can exercise discretion and are potentially subject to conflicts of interest, and so risk being a source of manipulation. Contributing to a benchmark is a voluntary activity. If any initiative requires contributors to significantly change their business models, they could cease to contribute. However, for entities already subject to regulation and supervision, requiring good governance and control systems is not expected to lead to substantial costs or disproportionate administrative burden. Therefore this Regulation imposes certain obligations on supervised contributors. When a benchmark is determined on the basis of readily available data, the source of such data should not be considered to be a contributor.</p>

               <p>Financial benchmarks are not only used in the issuance and manufacturing of financial instruments and contracts. The financial industry also relies on benchmarks for measuring the performance of investment funds for the purpose of return tracking or of determining the asset allocation of a portfolio or of computing the performance fees. A given benchmark can be used either directly as a reference for financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, or indirectly within a combination of benchmarks. In the latter case, the setting and review of the weights to be assigned to various indices within a combination for the purpose of determining the pay-out or the value of a financial instrument or a financial contract or measuring the performance of an investment fund also amounts to use as such an activity does not involve discretion, in contrast to the activity of provision of benchmarks. The holding of financial instruments referencing a certain benchmark is not considered to be use of the benchmark.</p>

This Regulation should therefore set out requirements for adequate record-keeping by benchmark administrators relating to the calculation of the benchmark for a sufficient period of time. The reality that a benchmark intends to measure and the environment in which it is measured are likely to change over time. Therefore it is necessary that the process and methodology of the provision of benchmarks are reviewed on a periodic basis to identify shortcomings and possible improvements. Many stakeholders can be impacted by failures in the provision of the benchmark and can help identify such shortcomings.

It is therefore necessary that this Regulation requires administrators to take certain measures where an administrator considers that input data does not represent the market or economic reality that a benchmark intends to measure, comprising measures to change the input data, the contributors or the methodology or else to cease providing that benchmark. Furthermore, an administrator should, as part of its control framework, establish measures to monitor, where feasible, input data prior to the publication of the benchmark and to validate input data after publication, including comparing that data against historical patterns where applicable.</p>

               <p>The accuracy and reliability of a benchmark in measuring the economic reality it is intended to measure depends on the methodology and input data used. It is therefore necessary to adopt a transparent methodology that ensures the benchmark&apos;s reliability and accuracy. Such transparency does not mean the publication of the formula applied for the determination of a given benchmark, but rather the disclosure of elements sufficient to allow stakeholders to understand how the benchmark is derived and to assess its representativeness, relevance and appropriateness for its intended use.</p>

Competent authorities are also not required to publish administrative sanctions or other administrative measures which are deemed to be of a minor nature where publication would be disproportionate.</p>

               <p>Critical benchmarks can involve contributors, administrators and users in more than one Member State. Thus, the cessation of the provision of such a benchmark or any events that can significantly undermine its integrity could have an impact in more than one Member State, meaning that the supervision of such a benchmark only by the competent authority of the Member State in which the administrator of the benchmark is located will not be efficient and effective in terms of addressing the risks that the critical benchmark poses. In such a case, in order to ensure the effective exchange of supervisory information among competent authorities and coordination of their activities and supervisory measures, colleges, comprising competent authorities and ESMA, should be formed. The activities of the colleges should contribute to the harmonised application of rules under this Regulation and to the convergence of supervisory practices. The competent authority of the administrator should establish written arrangements regarding the exchange of information, the decision-making process, which could include rules on voting procedures, any cooperation for the purposes of mandatory contribution measures, and the cases where the competent authorities should consult each other. ESMA&apos;s legally binding mediation is a key element of the achievement of coordination, supervisory consistency and convergence of supervisory practices.</p>

               <p>Benchmarks can reference financial instruments and financial contracts that have a long duration. In certain cases, such benchmarks risk no longer being permitted to be provided once this Regulation comes into effect because they have characteristics that cannot be adjusted to conform to the requirements of this Regulation. At the same time, prohibiting the continued provision of such a benchmark could result in the termination or frustration of the financial instruments or financial contracts and so harm investors. It is therefore necessary to make provision to allow for the continued provision of such benchmarks for a transitional period.</p>

               <p>In order to specify further technical elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the specification of technical elements of definitions; in respect of the calculation of the nominal amounts of financial instruments, notional amount of derivatives and the net asset value of investment funds referencing a benchmark to determine whether such benchmark is critical; in respect of reviewing the calculation method used to determine the threshold for the determination of critical and significant benchmarks; in respect of establishing the objective reasons for the endorsement of a benchmark or family of benchmarks provided in a third country; in respect of establishing the elements to assess whether the cessation or the changing of an existing benchmark could reasonably result in a force majeure event, frustrate or otherwise breach the terms of any financial contract or financial instrument, or the rules of any investment fund, which references such benchmark; and in respect of the extension of the 24-month period envisaged for the registration instead of authorisation of certain administrators. When adopting those acts, the Commission should take into account the market or technological developments and the international convergence of supervisory practice in relation to benchmarks, in particular the work of IOSCO. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="14">

               <p>Technical standards should ensure consistent harmonisation of the requirements for the provision of and contribution to indices used as benchmarks and adequate protection of investors and consumers across the Union. As a body with highly specialised expertise, it would be efficient and appropriate to entrust ESMA with the elaboration of draft regulatory technical standards which do not involve policy choices for submission to the Commission. The Commission should adopt draft regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, regarding the procedures and the characteristics of the oversight function; regarding how to ensure the appropriateness and the verifiability of the input data as well as the internal oversight and verification procedures of a contributor; regarding the information to be provided by an administrator about the benchmark and methodology; regarding the elements of the code of conduct; regarding the requirements concerning systems and controls; regarding the criteria that the competent authority should take into account when deciding whether to apply certain additional requirements; regarding the contents of the benchmark statement and the cases in which an update of such a statement is required; regarding the minimum content of the cooperation arrangements between the competent authorities and ESMA; regarding the form and content of the application for recognition of a third country administrator and presentation of the information that is to be provided with such an application; and regarding the information to be provided in the application for authorisation or registration.</p>

               <p>Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 requires persons discharging managerial responsibilities, as well as persons closely associated with them, to notify the issuer and the competent authority of every transaction conducted on their own account relating to financial instruments that are themselves linked to shares and debt instruments of their issuer. However, there are a variety of financial instruments that are linked to shares and debt instruments of a given issuer. Such financial instruments include units in collective investment undertakings, structured products or financial instruments embedding a derivative that provides exposure to the performance of shares or debt instruments issued by an issuer. Every transaction in such financial instruments above a <i>de minimis</i> threshold should be subject to notification to the issuer and the competent authority. An exception should be made where either the linked financial instrument provides an exposure of 20 % or less to the issuer&apos;s shares or debt instruments, or the person discharging managerial responsibilities or person closely associated with them did not and could not know the investment composition of the linked financial instrument. Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 should therefore be amended,</p>

The Commission shall take into account elements such as the specificities of the underlying market or economic reality the benchmark intends to measure, the need for proximity of the provision of the benchmark to such market or economic reality, the need for proximity of the provision of the benchmark to contributors, the material availability of input data due to different time zones, and specific skills required in the provision of the benchmark.</p>
