It concluded that concerning the MRLs for pears, wine grapes, tomatoes and aubergines some information was not available and that further consideration by risk managers was required. As there is no risk for consumers, the MRLs for those products should be set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 at the existing level or the level identified by the Authority. These MRLs will be reviewed; the review will take into account the information available within two years from the publication of this Regulation. The Authority concluded that concerning the MRLs for cucumbers, courgettes, bovine muscle, fat, liver and kidney, sheep muscle, fat, liver and kidney, goat muscle, fat, liver and kidney, bovine, sheep and goat milk no information was available and that further consideration by risk managers was required. The MRLs for these products should be set at the specific limit of determination. As not data were available for setting MRLs in commodities of animal origin, also the MRL for apple, which is used as animal feed, should be set at the specific limit of determination.</p>
