               <p>The ECB carries out its supervisory tasks within the SSM, which should ensure that the Union&apos;s policy relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions is implemented in a coherent and effective manner, that the single rulebook for financial services is applied in the same manner to credit institutions in all Member States concerned, and that those credit institutions are subject to supervision of the highest quality.

               <p>In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, the ECB applies all relevant Union law and, where this Union law is composed of directives, the national legislation transposing those directives. Where the relevant Union law is composed of regulations and where currently those regulations explicitly grant options and discretions for Member States, the ECB should also apply the national legislation exercising those options and discretions. Such national legislation should not affect the smooth functioning of the SSM, for which the ECB is responsible.</p>

               <p>With regard to the legitimate expectations of supervised credit institutions, the ECB acknowledges the need to allow for transitional periods where its exercise of discretions significantly departs from the approach taken by the national competent authorities prior to the entry into force of this Regulation. In this respect, both credit institutions applying the Standardised Approach and the Internal Ratings Based Approach should have an appropriate transitional period. Therefore, credit institutions must apply the threshold for the assessment of the materiality of a credit obligation past due set by this Regulation not later than 31 December 2020 and must notify the ECB, before 1 June 2019, of the exact date on which they will commence applying such threshold.</p>
