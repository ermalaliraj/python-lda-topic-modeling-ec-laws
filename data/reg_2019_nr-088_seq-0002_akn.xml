               <p>At its annual meeting in 2018, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) maintained conservation measures for swordfish and tropical tunas. Those measures should be implemented in the law of the Union.</p>

               <p>At its annual meeting in 2019, the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) adopted new catch limits for jack mackerel (<i>Trachurus murphyi</i>) and approved exploratory fisheries for toothfish (<i>Dissostichus</i> spp.). The applicable measures should be implemented in the law of the Union.</p>

Sandeel is a short-lived species and the relevant scientific advice becomes available in the second half of February, while the fishing activities start in April.</p>

They should be established as part of the fishing opportunities.</p>
