               <p>Directive 2000/9/EC is based on the &apos;new approach&apos; principles, as set out in the Council Resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical harmonisation and standards<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">
                     <p>OJ C 136, 4.6.1985, p. 1.</p>
                  </authorialNote>. Thus, it sets out only the essential requirements applying to cableway installations, whereas technical details are adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cenelec) in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">
                     <p>Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European Standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC, 2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Decision 87/95/EEC and Decision No 1673/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 316, 14.11.2012, p. 12).</p>
                  </authorialNote>. Conformity with the harmonised standards so set, the reference numbers of which are published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>, provides a presumption of conformity with the requirements of Directive 2000/9/EC. Experience has shown that those basic principles have worked well in that sector and should be maintained and even further promoted.</p>

               <p>Experience acquired from the implementation of Directive 2000/9/EC has shown the need to modify some of its provisions in order to clarify and update them and thus ensure legal certainty, mainly as regards the scope and the conformity assessment of subsystems.</p>

               <p>Since the scope, essential requirements and conformity assessment procedures have to be identical in all Member States, there is almost no flexibility in transposing a directive based on the new approach principles into national law. In order to simplify the regulatory framework, Directive 2000/9/EC should be replaced by a regulation, which is the appropriate legal instrument as it imposes clear and detailed rules which do not give room for divergent transposition by Member States and thus ensures a uniform implementation throughout the Union.</p>

               <p>The scope of this Regulation should reflect the scope of Directive 2000/9/EC. This Regulation should apply to cableway installations designed to transport persons used in particular in high-altitude tourist resorts, in urban transport facilities or in sports facilities. Cableway installations are mainly lift systems, such as funicular railways, aerial ropeways (cable cars, gondolas, chairlifts) and drag lifts. Traction by cable and the passenger transport function are the essential criteria in determining whether a cableway installation is covered by this Regulation.</p>

This Regulation does not apply to the relocation of cableway installations installed on the territory of the Union or to the relocation of subsystems or safety components that were incorporated into such installations, except where such relocation implies a major modification of the cableway installation.</p>

An efficient traceability system facilitates the market surveillance authorities&apos; task of tracing economic operators who made non-compliant subsystems or safety components available on the market.
