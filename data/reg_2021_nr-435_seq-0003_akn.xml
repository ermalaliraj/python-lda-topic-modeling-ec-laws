               <p>The Communication from the Commission of 29 November 2017 entitled &apos;The Future of Food and Farming&apos; sets out the challenges, objectives and orientations for the future common agricultural policy (CAP) after 2020. Those objectives include making the CAP more result-driven, boosting modernisation and sustainability, including the economic, social, environmental and climate sustainability of the agricultural, forestry and rural areas, and helping reduce the Union legislation-related administrative burden for beneficiaries.</p>

               <p>Since the CAP needs to sharpen its responses to the challenges and opportunities as they manifest themselves at international, Union, national, regional, local and farm levels, it is necessary to streamline the governance of the CAP and improve its delivery on the Union objectives and to significantly decrease the administrative burden. The CAP should be based on delivery of performance. Therefore, the Union should set the basic policy parameters, such as the objectives of the CAP and its basic requirements, while Member States should bear greater responsibility as to how they meet the objectives and achieve targets. Enhanced subsidiarity makes it possible to better take into account local conditions and needs and the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions, tailoring the support to maximise the contribution to the achievement of Union objectives.</p>

               <p>Union wine policy, with its existing scheme of authorisations that has allowed for the orderly growth of vine plantings since 2016, has contributed to increasing the competitiveness of the Union wine sector and to encouraging high-quality production. While the wine sector has achieved a balance between production supply, quality, consumer demand and exports on the world market, that balance is not yet sufficiently longstanding or stable, in particular when the wine sector is faced with serious market disturbances. In addition, there is a trend towards a continued decrease in wine consumption in the Union due to changes in consumer habits and lifestyle. As a consequence, in the long term the liberalisation of new vine plantings risks threatening the balance achieved so far between the supply capacity of the sector, a fair standard of living for producers and reasonable prices for consumers. This risks jeopardising the positive developments achieved through Union legislation and policies in recent decades.</p>

               <p>The existing scheme of authorisations for vine plantings is also considered essential to ensuring diversity of wines and responding to the specificities of the Union wine sector. The Union wine sector has specific characteristics, including the long cycle of vineyards, given that production only takes place several years after planting but then continues for several decades, and given the potential for considerable fluctuations in production from one harvest to the next. Unlike many wine-producing third countries, the Union wine sector is also characterised by a very high number of small, family-run farms, which results in a diverse range of wines. In order to guarantee the economic viability of their projects and to improve the competitiveness of the Union wine sector on the global market, operators in the sector and producers therefore need long-term predictability, given the significant investment required to plant a vineyard.</p>

               <p>In order to secure the achievements of the Union wine sector up to now and to achieve a long-lasting quantitative and qualitative balance in the sector through the continued orderly growth of vine plantings beyond 2030, the scheme of authorisations for vine plantings should be extended until 2045, i.e. for a period equivalent to the initial period in place since 2016, but with two mid-term reviews to be carried out in 2028 and 2040, in order to evaluate the scheme and, if necessary, to present proposals on the basis of the results of those mid-term reviews to improve the competitiveness of the wine sector.</p>

               <p>Allowing producers to delay the replanting of vineyards could have a positive environmental impact by improving soil sanitary conditions with fewer chemical inputs. Therefore, in order to contribute to a better soil management in viticulture, it is appropriate to allow for the extension of the validity of replanting authorisations from three to six years where the replanting takes place on the same parcel of land.</p>

Due to the prolonged effects of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, producers holding planting authorisations for new plantings or for replanting that were due to expire in 2020 or 2021 continue to be largely prevented from using those authorisations in the last year of their validity. To avoid the loss of those authorisations and to reduce the risk of the deterioration of the conditions under which the planting would need to be carried out, it is appropriate to allow for a further extension of the validity of planting authorisations for new plantings or for replanting which expire in 2020 and a extension for those which expire in 2021. All planting authorisations for new plantings or for replanting that were due to expire in 2020 or 2021 should therefore be extended until 31 December 2022.</p>

To that end, it is necessary to lay down the conditions under which certain grapevine products may be de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised and to establish the processes for de-alcoholisation that are authorised. Those conditions should take into account the Resolutions of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV), OIV-ECO 432-2012 Beverage Obtained By Dealcoholisation of Wine, OIV-ECO 433-2012 Beverage Obtained By Partial Dealcoholisation of Wine and OIV-ECO 523-2016 Wine With An Alcohol Content Modified by Dealcoholisation and OIV-OENO 394A-2012 Dealcoholisation Of Wines.</p>

Therefore, although both partial and total de-alcoholisation should be authorised for wines without a geographical indication or a designation of origin, only partial de-alcoholisation should be authorised for wines with a protected geographical indication or protected designation of origin. In addition, to ensure clarity and transparency for both producers and consumers of wines with a geographical indication or a designation of origin, it is appropriate to provide that, where wines with a geographical indication or a designation of origin may be partially de-alcoholised, their product specification should contain a description of the partially de-alcoholised wine and, where applicable, the specific oenological practices to be used to make the partially de-alcoholised wine or wines, as well as the relevant restrictions on making them.</p>

It is appropriate for reasons of legal certainty to provide for the application of the increased quantitative limit with retroactive effect from 1 January 2021.</p>

               <p>To help achieve the environmental objectives of the Union, Member States should be able to recognise producer organisations that pursue specific aims relating to the management and valorisation of by-products, residual flows and waste, in particular to protect the environment and boost circularity, as well as producer organisations that pursue aims relating to the management of mutual funds for any sector. It is therefore appropriate to extend the existing list of objectives of producer organisations set out in Article 152 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. To increase the transparency of producer organisations, the statutes of producer organisations should also enable producer members to scrutinise democratically the accounts and budgets of the organisation. Moreover, for the ease of commercial transactions engaged in by the producer organisation, it is appropriate to lay down that the statutes of a producer organisation may allow producer members to be in direct contact with purchasers, provided that such direct contact does not jeopardise the producer organisation&apos;s function of concentrating supply and placing products on the market and provided that the producer organisation continues to have sole discretion over the essential elements of sales effected by the producer organisation.</p>

               <p>The experience in different sectors shows that Member States may recognise interbranch organisations at different geographical levels without undermining the role and the aims of such organisations. Therefore, it is pertinent to clarify that Member States may opt for the recognition of such interbranch organisations at one or more geographical levels. Interbranch organisations are to pursue a specific aim taking account of the interests of their members and of consumers. In light of the environmental objectives of the Union, it is appropriate to extend the list of objectives set out in Article 157 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 to include providing the necessary information and carrying out the necessary research to develop products that are more suited to climate action and to the protection of animal health and animal welfare, contributing to the valorisation of by-products and the reduction and management of waste, and promoting and implementing measures to prevent, control and manage animal health, plant-protection and environmental risks, including by setting up and managing funds or by contributing to such funds with a view to paying financial compensation to farmers for the costs and economic losses arising from the promotion and implementation of such measures. To avoid the risk of organisations at a certain stage of the food supply chain concentrating more power, Member States should recognise only interbranch organisations that strive for a balanced representation of the organisations in various stages of the food supply chain that constitute the interbranch organisation.</p>

In order to foster sustainable practices, it should be possible to make agreements, decisions and concerted practices of interbranch organisations related to plant health, animal health, food safety and environmental risks binding on non-members.

               <p>In view of the importance of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications for agricultural production in the Union, and in view of the success of the introduction of supply management rules for cheeses and dry-cured hams under geographical indications in ensuring the added value and maintaining the reputation of those products and stabilising their prices, the possibility of applying supply management rules should be extended to agricultural products with a protected designation of origin or geographical indication under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 or Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012. For clarity and consistency, it is appropriate to integrate the existing rules on the regulation of supply into one single provision covering all agricultural products. Member States should therefore be authorised to apply those rules to regulate the supply of agricultural products under geographical indications at the request of an interbranch organisation, producer organisation, or a group of producers or operators, provided that at least two-thirds of the producers of that product, or their representatives, agree, and, where applicable, the agricultural producers of the raw material concerned have been consulted, and, in the case of cheese, for reasons of continuity, have given their agreement. Those rules should be subject to strict conditions, in particular in order to avoid damage to trade in products in other markets and to protect minority rights. Member States should immediately publish and notify the adopted rules to the Commission, ensure regular checks and repeal the rules in cases of non-compliance. The Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts requiring that a Member State repeal such rules if the Commission finds that the rules do not comply with certain conditions, prevent or distort competition in a substantial part of the internal market or jeopardise free trade or the attainment of the objectives of Article 39 TFEU. In light of the Commission&apos;s powers in the field of Union competition policy, and given the special nature of those acts, the Commission should adopt such implementing acts without applying Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.</p>

               <p>The special commercial value of wines covered by a protected designation of origin (PDO) or protected geographical indication (PGI) derives from their belonging to a premium segment of the market thanks to their reputation for quality that derives from their product specifications. Such wines tend to fetch higher prices in the market as consumers value the characteristics to which the designation of origin and geographical indication attests. To prevent those quality credentials from being undercut by detrimental price action, interbranch organisations representing the operators benefiting from those quality credentials should be able to issue price guidance concerning the sales of the relevant grapes by way of derogation from Article 101(1) TFEU. However, such guidance should be non-mandatory, in order to avoid eliminating intra-PDO/PGI price competition altogether.</p>

               <p>Certain vertical and horizontal initiatives concerning agricultural and food products, which aim to apply requirements that are more stringent than the mandatory requirements, can have positive effects on sustainability objectives. The conclusion of such agreements, decisions and concerted practices between producers and operators at different levels of the production, processing and trade could also strengthen the position of producers in the supply chain and increase their bargaining power. Therefore, under specific circumstances, such initiatives should not be subject to the application of Article 101(1) TFEU. In order to ensure the effective use of this new derogation, and in the interest of reducing administrative burdens, such initiatives should not require a prior Commission decision to the effect that they are not to be subject to the application of Article 101(1) TFEU. As this is a new derogation, it is appropriate to provide that the Commission should produce guidelines for operators concerning the application of the derogation within two years of the entry into force of this Regulation. After that date, producers should also be able to request an opinion from the Commission concerning the application of the derogation to their agreements, decisions and concerted practices. In justified cases, the Commission should be able to subsequently revise the content of its opinion. National competition authorities should be able to decide that an agreement, decision or concerted practice is to be modified, discontinued or not take place at all, if they consider it necessary to protect competition, in which case they should inform the Commission of their actions.</p>

In order to take into account an aromatised wine-based drink existing on the Polish market, it is appropriate to create the new category &apos;wino ziołowe&apos;, setting out in Union law the traditional requirements for its production.</p>

               <p>Given its small size, remoteness and specific situation concerning food security, local markets in Réunion are particularly vulnerable to price fluctuations. Interbranch organisations bring together producers and other operators of different stages of the food supply chain and can play a role in supporting the maintenance and diversification of local production. In the specific context of food security in Réunion, it is appropriate to provide, by way of derogation from Article 165 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, that where rules of a recognised interbranch organisation are extended to operators who are not members of the interbranch organisation, France may decide, after consulting the relevant stakeholders, that operators who are not members of the interbranch organisation are required to pay financial contributions for the activities covered by extended rules which are in the general economic interest of economic operators whose activities are solely carried out in Réunion in relation to products which are destined for the local market.</p>

Notwithstanding Article 164(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, an interbranch organisation is to be regarded as being a representative under this Article where it accounts for at least 70 % of the volume of production, trade or processing of the product or products concerned.</p>
