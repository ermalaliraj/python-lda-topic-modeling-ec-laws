               <p>For that active substance, the European Food Safety Authority (&apos;the Authority&apos;) submitted a reasoned opinion on the existing MRLs in accordance with Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">
                     <p>European Food Safety Authority; Review of the existing maximum residue levels for prochloraz according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. <i>EFSA Journal</i> 2018; 16(8):5401.</p>
                  </authorialNote>. The Authority proposed to change the residue definition to the sum of prochloraz, BTS 44595 (M201-04) and BTS 44596 (M201-03), expressed as prochloraz. The Authority identified a risk for consumers concerning the MRLs for citrus fruits, kiwi, bananas, mangoes, pineapples and bovine liver. It is therefore appropriate to lower these MRLs to the Limit of Determination (LOD) or the level identified by the Authority. The Authority recommended lowering the MRLs for garlic, shallots, lettuces and salad plants, purslanes, herbs and edible flowers, peas, linseeds, sunflower seeds, rapeseeds/canola seeds, barley, oat, rice, rye, wheat, coffee beans, herbal infusions from flowers, leaves and herbs and roots, spices, sugar beet roots, bovine (fat, kidney), equine fat and poultry liver. As there is no risk for consumers, the MRLs for those products should be set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 at the level identified by the Authority. The Authority concluded that concerning the Codex maximum residue levels (CXLs) for kumquats, litchis/lychees, passionfruits/maracujas, prickly pears/cactus fruits, star apples/cainitos, American persimmons/Virginia kaki, avocados, papayas, Granate apples/pomegranates, cherimoyas, guavas, breadfruits, durians and soursops/guanabanas, some information was not available in relation to the new residue definition and that further consideration by risk managers was required. As there is no risk for consumers, the MRLs for those products should be set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 at the level of the existing CXLs. These MRLs will be reviewed; the review will take into account the information available within two years from the publication of this Regulation.</p>

               <p>As regards products on which the use of the plant protection products concerned is not authorised, and for which no import tolerances or CXLs exist, MRLs should be set at the specific limit of determination or the default MRL should apply, as provided for in Article 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.</p>

               <p>The Commission consulted the European Union reference laboratories for residues of pesticides as regards the need to adapt certain limits of determination. As regards several substances, those laboratories concluded that for certain commodities technical development requires the setting of specific limits of determination.</p>
