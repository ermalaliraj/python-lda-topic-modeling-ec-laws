               <p>On 2 July 2014, the Swedish Medical Products Agency, which is the Swedish competent authority for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, adopted and communicated a decision under Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 introducing provisional restrictive measures on a nail cosmetic product that had caused a high number of undesirable effects. The substances identified as likely to cause those undesirable effects were HEMA and Di-HEMA TMHDC.</p>

                  </authorialNote> that &apos;HEMA and di-HEMA-TMHDC, when applied appropriately to the nail plate (â€¦) as part of an artificial nail modelling system, are not likely to pose a risk of sensitisation, provided that their use is restricted to the nail plate only and contact with the adjacent skin is avoided&apos;. The SCCS further concluded that &apos;[b]oth HEMA and di-HEMA-TMHDC are weak to moderate sensitisers and pose a risk of sensitisation from misuse of the products or from inappropriately carried out application or from unintentional contamination of the skin adjacent to the nails under normal and reasonably foreseeable conditions of use&apos;.</p>

               <p>When assessing &apos;normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use&apos;, account has to be taken of possible misuse, inappropriate or unintentional use.

               <p>Cases of sensitisation to nail products containing HEMA and Di-HEMA TMHDC reported in some Member States lead the Commission to the conclusion that there is a risk that such products may be applied with insufficient precision, causing contact with the skin adjacent to the nail plate.</p>

               <p>A distinction should be made between professional and consumer use of cosmetic products. Higher safety standards are expected from professionals.

               <p>As regards consumers, since the SCCS opinion considers the substances HEMA and Di-HEMA TMHDC safe in nail products only when applied on the nail plate and since &apos;normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use&apos; should take into account the possibility of application on the skin adjacent to the nail plate, there is a potential risk to human health from the use of HEMA and Di-HEMA TMHDC in nail products.</p>

               <p>As the use of nail products containing HEMA and Di-HEMA TMHDC by professionals is expected to be safer for the consumer, such products should be used only by professionals and therefore the warning &apos;for professional use only&apos; should be added on the package of such products.</p>

               <p>To draw attention of both professionals and consumers to the potential health risk, the warning &apos;can cause an allergic reaction&apos; should be added on the package of nail products containing HEMA and Di-HEMA TMHDC.</p>

               <p>Therefore, the safeguard measure taken by Sweden should be considered as justified. Consequently, it is necessary to impose a restriction on the use of HEMA and Di-HEMA TMHDC in nail products.</p>
