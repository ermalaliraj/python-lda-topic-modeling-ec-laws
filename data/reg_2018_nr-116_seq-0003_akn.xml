                  </authorialNote> claimed that its rights of defence were violated as no information regarding the Commission&apos;s intention to make imports of the product concerned subject to registration had been communicated to it before the entry into force of the registration regulation.

               <p>The Commission observed that prior disclosure is mandatory under Article 20(2) of the basic Regulation before the imposition of definitive measures. The same does not apply to a registration decision under Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation. That Article only provides for the prior information to Member States in due time. Moreover, the right to be heard under Article 41(2)(a) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union only applies to individual adverse measures. In this case, the Commission directed the Union customs authorities to register imports. The registration regulation is not an individual measure affecting the Hankook Group adversely. It was neither addressed to the Hankook Group nor did it produce individual negative effects for that group. Therefore, neither the rights of defence of the Hankook Group nor Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union were violated.</p>

                  </authorialNote>, claimed that the anonymity of two Union producers represented by the complainant could seriously affect the parties&apos; right of defence as it is not possible to verify that the complainant effectively represents more than 25 % of total Union production. In addition, the anonymity does not allow interested parties to know in which tier<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="9">
                     <p>Information collected and received by the Commission indicates that the Union market for bus and lorry tyres is segmented in three tiers. Tier 1 tyres cover premium new tyres with the flagship brand of main manufacturers. Tier 2 tyres cover most non-premium tyres, both new and retreaded tyres, with prices and mileage performances ranging between approximately 65 % and 80 % of the price of tier 1 tyres. Tier 3 tyres cover both new and retreaded tyres with lower mileage performances and very limited retreadability.</p>
                  </authorialNote> the complainant is active and thus, to meaningfully comment on the material injury that it could suffer due to Chinese exports of the product concerned to the Union. Moreover, the Giti Group claimed that, according to the complainant, tier 3 Union production represented only 16 % of total Union production. Therefore, it argued that the initiation of the proceedings constituted an infringement of Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation. Finally, the Giti Group and the Aeolus Group argued that confidentiality hinders interested parties from knowing whether sampled Union producers are related to Chinese exporting producers.</p>

               <num>(16)</num>
               <p>Article 19 of the basic Regulation stipulates that the Commission must not reveal any information which is confidential without specific permission from the supplier of such information. The Commission considered that the open version of the complaint permitted interested parties to assess the standing requirements. Moreover, the representativity of the complainant needs to be assessed on the overall basis of the alleged injured industry and not per market tier. Finally, the Commission was not convinced by the argument that the lack of knowledge of potential links between anonymous complainants and Chinese exporting producers should impede the rights of defence of interested parties. The claims levied against granting of confidentiality were therefore rejected.</p>

               <p>Finally, the Giti Group submitted that the Commission should have terminated this investigation immediately because of the procedurally erroneous pre-selection of the sample of Union producers. The Commission recalled that the provisional selection of a sample of Union producers is legally possible and conducive to an effective investigation within tight deadlines. As demonstrated in recitals (21) to (25), the provisional sample was changed further to comments from interested parties. Consequently, the claim was rejected.</p>

               <p>In order to decide whether sampling was necessary and, if so, to select a sample, the Commission asked unrelated importers to provide the information specified in the Notice of Initiation. Five importers came forward importing around 430000 units of imports from the PRC. Two companies were sampled accounting for [70 % - 90 %] of the importers that submitted a sampling form.</p>

               <p>The complainant claimed that the proposed sample was not representative enough as it did not sufficiently take into account the different price segments called tiers on the Union tyre market. According to the complainant, the intermediate segment (tier 2) was over-represented in the sample while the overwhelming majority of Chinese exporters operated in the lower segment (tier 3), which was underrepresented. Therefore, it claimed that the sampled exporting producers would not adequately reflect the average import price to the Union. The complainant requested to replace sampled exporting producers in tier 2 with exporting producers in tier 3.</p>

               <p>CRIA, CCCMC and the Giti Group accepted, in principle, the provisionally selected sample, but considered that given the large number of exporting producers the sample&apos;s representativeness could be further increased by adding more companies.</p>

               <p>The Commission considered that the proposed sample consisted of exporting producers from both the intermediate and lower tiers accounting for over 50 % of total imports from the PRC to the Union. Replacing the largest exporting producers from tier 2 with smaller exporting producers from tier 3 would make the sample unrepresentative given that a large portion of the total exports were, according to the available data, in the intermediate tier.</p>

               <p>Subsequently, the European Retreading Association (&apos;BIPAVER&apos;) and the European Tyre &amp; Rubber Manufacturers Association (&apos;ETRMA&apos;) claimed that the finally selected sample could lead to a strong imbalance in the product mix between tier 2 and tier 3 tyres. In their view, the average import prices might not accurately reflect the part of import volumes that are most harmful to the Union industry. Therefore, they urged the Commission to reassess and amend the sample and, at least, add one exporting producer with significant export volumes from the tier 3.</p>

               <p>The Commission reassessed whether it would be practically feasible to further enlarge the sample. It pointed out that the groups of exporting producers selected in the sample consisted of: (1) 13 legal entities that were involved in the production and domestic sales of the product concerned; (2) two related exporters located outside of the Union; and (3) more than ten related importers located in the Union. The data provided by each of these entities needed to be processed and verified. Therefore, the Commission considered that more exporting producers could not be reasonably investigated within the time available.</p>

               <p>Retreading is essentially a recycling process whereby worn tyres are refurbished through a replacement of the tread on an old casing. Casings are main elements of the retreading process, and, as such a substantial part of the retreader activity is the selection and acquisition of casings suitable for retreading. Casings are thereby the main input of the production process and constitute &#45; depending of their quality &#45; either a real &apos;semi-finished&apos; product or a waste.</p>

               <p>Tyres for lorries or buses are sold in two types and four categories. Tube type tyre is a more traditional option; it has an inner tube, which has its own valve, placed inside the tyre. In a tubeless tire, the tire and the rim of the wheel form an airtight seal, with the valve being directly mounted on the rim. An overwhelming majority of tyres for lorries or buses sold in the Union are tubeless tyres. The four categories of tyres for lorries or buses are: steer, drive, trailer and multi-position. Steer tyres are designed to be used on the front axle to aid with steering, but can be used in all positions on the lorries or bus depending on the vehicle&apos;s use. Drive tyres are designed for the drive train and provide better traction. Trailer tyres are designed to be mounted on trailers, while multi-position tyres are designed to be used in all in all positions on a vehicle depending on its use.</p>

               <p>Tier 1 tyres cover premium new tyres with the flagship brand of main manufacturers. Brand recognition is a key factor for tyres in this tier and justifies significantly higher prices for expected high performances as well particularly strong marketing investments. Original equipment for lorries or buses manufacturers (&apos;OE1&apos;) tyres are primarily included in that tier. The quality of tier 1 tyres ensures a high level of retreadability of the tyres which are designed to be &apos;multi-life&apos; tyres further increasing the significantly higher mileage of the original product (up to three retreading for a normal use). Tier 1 tyres are also associated with a higher level of safety and are often accompanied with a good level of after-sale services.</p>

Original equipment for trailers manufacturers (&apos;OE2&apos;) tyres may be included in that tier. Brand recognition remains important in this tier and brands are usually well-known from purchasers which are also able to identify the tyre manufacturers.

               <p>The main difference in technical characteristics between a newly produced tyre and a retreaded tyre built on its casing is that a retreaded tyre may indeed have a shorter lifespan and the retreaded tyre may be perceived as a less safe option.

               <p>Regarding the claim concerning the product definition in anti-dumping cases in third countries, the Commission pointed out that the product definition falls within the wide margin of discretion of the investigating authority in trade defence matters.<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="16">

               <p>It was also submitted that the product concerned should not be covered by several CN codes. In this regard, the Commission recalled, first, that it is very common that a single product concerned is covered by several CN codes. This arises naturally from the design of the Combined Nomenclature. Furthermore, the Notice of Initiation clearly stated that the CN codes were given for information only. Second, no factual evidence was provided, nor did the Commission find information that the product concerned was defined in such a way that imported retreated and new tyres could not provisionally be found to constitute alternatives to, and compete directly with, retreaded and new tyres produced in the Union. The same applies to producer and consumer perceptions, channels of distribution, or other factors as to the existence of a single or multiple product categories as opposed to the differentiation between new and retreaded tyres for the purposes of this investigation.</p>

In this respect, they claimed that the use of a non-market economy methodology to reach a determination after 11 December 2016 is contrary to the Union&apos;s WTO obligations.

Given that the domestic production in South Africa was considerably smaller than in Brazil both in relative and absolute terms, the Commission decided to select Brazil as the most appropriate analogue country under Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation.</p>

               <p>Some product types produced in the analogue country could not be matched with the product types exported from the country concerned to the Union because the analogue country producer did not manufactures all the tyres dimensions and tyre types exported to the Union. Therefore, the normal value for the non-matching product types had to be constructed pursuant to Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation on the basis of the analogue country&apos;s producer&apos;s manufacturing costs plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs (&apos;SG&amp;A&apos;) and for profit.</p>

               <p>The Commission calculated the average Cost of Manufacturing (&apos;COM&apos;) per kg for each position of the tyre &#45; front, drive, multi-position or trailer for each respective tier (1, 2 or 3) and for each type of tyre (tubeless or tube type, based on the verified production cost data from the Brazilian producer. Such average COM was within the range of CNY 20,03/kg and CNY 21,29/kg. The Commission constructed the value of each non-matching Product Code Number exported by the Chinese producers by multiplying its weight by the average COM for each tyre position, type and tier. The Commission then added a reasonable amount for SG&amp;A (35 &#45; 45 % of COM) based on actual data pertaining to production and sales, as provided for in Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation. It finally added a reasonable amount of profit (23 &#45; 28 % of COM) by using the average profit margin of sales of the profitable products.</p>

               <p>With respect to one subsidiary of the Aeolus Group, (Pirelli Tyre Co., Ltd), the Commission did not receive within the set deadline the necessary data to establish the export price. On 23 March 2018 the Commission informed the company that questionnaires provided by its related importers were incomplete and it was requested to revise and re-submit the questionnaires replies. The company was informed that failing to provide complete and accurate information within the given deadline, the Commission could revert to the use of facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation. On 4 April 2018 the company in question provided revised replies. However, the Commission considered them still to be incomplete and could not therefore be processed for the purpose of the dumping and injury analysis. As a result, the Commission has established the dumping margin based on the information verified from the other verified companies of the Aeolus Group, namely Aeolus Tyre and Chonche Auto Double Happiness Tyre. The Aeolus Group was invited to update the data concerning Pirelli for the remainder of the proceeding.</p>

               <p>The Union market for lorry and bus tyres is a very competitive market, with multiple producers and brands.</p>

               <num>(135)</num>
               <p>The Union market is divided between the original equipment sales to lorry or bus manufacturers and the replacement market. Market demand for lorry and bus tyres in the original equipment sector is driven by lorry and bus production while the aftermarket sector is influenced by many factors, including economic activity, sales, size, composition and use of the lorries or buses and fleets in service. Chinese imports&apos; sales are concentrated mainly in the replacement market.</p>

               <num>(136)</num>
               <p>Around 17 % of the total Union consumption is original equipment sold to lorries and buses manufacturers. The remainder of lorries and bus tyres sales in the Union are sold as replacement tyres directly or indirectly to the lorries or bus owners. The replacement tyres cover a broader range of tyres and are sold through a wider variety of channels with different marketing strategies. Replacement tyres may be sold directly to end-users or through related or unrelated distributors which will then resell to the end-users.</p>

               <p>Main sales channels are sales to distributors who resell them to fleet owners or direct sales to fleet owners sometimes alongside services (control, maintenance, services).</p>

               <p>Branding also influences the price customers are willing to pay for lorry and bus tyres. Brands are often linked with perceived quality and service, and more for higher quality tyres.</p>

            <p>Interconnection between new and retreaded tyres</p>

               <num>(139)</num>
               <p>The Commission determined that the main Union producers concentrated in tiers 1 and 2, where tyres were/are designed to have a long life cycle and to be retreadable. That justified significantly higher prices (and profit margins) for expected high performances for tiers 1 and 2 tyres.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d119e1871">
               <num>(140)</num>
               <p>In fact, the investigation showed that the larger Union producers actively market retreadability of their tyres as a way to create brand loyalty and distinguish themselves from lower-priced imports of tier 3 tyres. As such, the investigation has shown that a large part of the value attributed to tiers 1 and 2 tyres originate, in fact, from the existence of the retreading industry in tier 3.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d119e1877">
               <num>(141)</num>
               <p>The high interchangeability of retreaded and new tyres, however, makes tier 3 also the most vulnerable to low-priced Chinese imports of the product concerned. This is true in particular when considering that the users are aware that, performance-wise, retreaded and low-quality new tyres are not significantly distinguishable. That interchangeability in turn, establishes price as the determining factor in the customer&apos;s decision to purchase a retreaded or tier 3 new tyres.</p>

               <p>The price comparison was made on a type-by-type basis for transactions at the same level of trade, duly adjusted where necessary, and after deduction of rebates and discounts. The result of the comparison was expressed as a percentage of the sampled Union producers&apos; turnover during the investigation period. It showed a weighted average undercutting margin of between 21 % and 31 % by the imports of the product concerned from the country concerned on the Union market. Moreover, the weighted average undercutting margin in the three tiers was found to be significant: 24 % for tiers 1 and 2 and between 21 % and 31 % for tier 3. The substantial level of undercutting demonstrates the pronounced effect of dumping in this case.</p>

               <p>For the injury determination, the Commission distinguished between macroeconomic and microeconomic injury indicators. The Commission evaluated the macroeconomic indicators on the basis of data contained in the complaint, Eurostat statistics, submissions from ETRMA, as appropriate, to ensure that the data related to all Union producers. The Commission evaluated the microeconomic indicators on the basis of data contained in the questionnaire replies from the sampled Union producers and the submission of ETRMA. The data related to the sampled Union producers. Both sets of data were found to be representative of the economic situation of the Union industry.</p>

               <p>As mentioned in recital (23), the Union producers are composed of two categories of companies in terms of size: large companies and SMEs (highly fragmented), representing 85 % and 15 % respectively of the total Union sales of the Union producers in 2016. However, as a result of the sampling of the Union producers, the sales data of the sampled SMEs represented around 4 % of the total Union sales of sampled Union producers. Therefore, the Commission decided to weight the results of the sampled Union producers in accordance with the market share of each category of companies. As SMEs are active only in tier 3 segment, this adjustment had as a direct consequence to increase the share of tier 3 sales within the set of data originating from the sampled Union producers.</p>

               <p>Moreover, the total Union sales of the Union producers were split between the three tiers in the following proportion: tier 1: 51 %, tier 2: 23 % and tier 3: 26 %. However, the Union sales data of the sampled Union producers, even after the adjustment described in recital (161), did not reflect the real proportion of Union sales per tier. Therefore, the Commission decided to weight the results of the sampled Union producers in accordance with the share of each tier in the total Union sales of the Union producers to ensure that the three tiers were represented according to their share in the total Union sales in all micro-indicators.</p>

               <p>Several parties submitted that if the Commission follows the segmentation by the three tiers the determination of injury needs to be carried out also at the level of tiers. In particular, the status of the Union industry as well as the impact of imports needed to be evaluated on a tier basis, for example the impact of tier 2 imports (both Chinese and from other countries) need to be assessed on tier 2 Union producers.</p>

               <p>The Commission considered that despite the segmentation of the Union market, the tyres as defined in recital (78) share the same basic physical, chemical and technical characteristics and are interchangeable. Consequently, the determination of injury was done for the product concerned in compliance with the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement. In particular, the Appellate Body&apos;s found that &apos;where investigating authorities undertake an examination of one part of a domestic industry, they should, in principle, examine, in like manner, all of the other parts that make up that industry, as well as examine the industry as a whole&apos;<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="17">

                  </authorialNote>. Therefore, a segmental analysis is possible under WTO law, but it has to be accompanied by an analysis of the whole industry. Similarly, the General Court accepted that the injury analysis may focus on the tier most affected by dumped imports<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="18">

               <p>Moreover, the Italian association of retreaders (&apos;AIRP&apos;) claimed that the retreading sector in the Union accounts for around 13000 jobs for production and distribution. Retreading activity is a rather labour intensive activity and a retreaded tyre supports 3 to 4 times the number of jobs of a new tyre. According to AIRP, several companies associated are currently reducing personnel or making a massive use of unemployment insurance funds.</p>

               <p>The overall profitability decreased from 15,6 % in 2014 to 13,7 % in the investigation period. This was calculated on the basis of the weight of each of the tiers in the sales, as explained in recitals (161) and (162). The decreasing profitability by 1,9 percentage points is the result of a sharper decrease in prices (&#45; 8 %) than the decrease in costs (&#45; 6 %).</p>

It increased from 2014 (17,9 %) to 2015 (21,8 %) and then decreased in the investigation period to a level slightly below 2014 (17,5 %). This is partly explained by the evolution of the cost of production and the prices, since in 2015 the cost of production decreased more than the selling prices.</p>

               <p>The Union market for tyres for buses or lorries has been strongly affected by the economic crisis. As the consumption of tyres is intrinsically linked to the purchase of new vehicles and of kilometres travelled by the fleets, it is very dependent on the overall economic activity. Any variation in the economic activity, and notably of the volume of goods transported by road, is reflected directly in the tyre sales. In a period when lorries are used less, acquisition of new lorries or replacement of lorries&apos; tyres becomes less necessary and therefore the tyres market declines.</p>

               <p>After the economic crisis, there has been a structural shift of demand from the higher tiers to the lower tiers, where price tends to drive the purchasing decision. In this context, the cheap offers of imported tyres and the preference of certain fleet owners to opt for cheaper tyres have played a major role in the reconfiguration of the Union market.</p>

               <p>As retreaders are under strong pressure, closure of plants and workshops have been increasingly numerous as set out in recital (175). Due to the lack of available local facilities, it becomes less possible to retread a high-quality worn out tyre. Consequently, the purchase of a high-quality tyre with the option of multiple retreadings becomes less attractive. In light of these developments and in the face of low-priced imports of tier 3 tyres, which accounted for most of the Chinese imports, Union producers of new tyres have no option but to strengthen their presence in tier 3, too.</p>

               <p>Finally, the intersegment competition is also clear from the impact of the prices in the lower tiers on the pricing in the higher tier. In the Union, prices of tier 1 tyres have felt the pressure of cheap imports. The complainant claimed that the impact was all the more obvious in regional areas where tier 3 tyres were more present (i.e. in these areas tier 1 tyres were typically priced at lower levels than in other areas of the Union which highlights the competitive impact of tier 3 tyres on tier 1 tyres).</p>

               <p>The table below shows the share per tier in the Union consumption in 2012 and in 2016. In that period, Union consumption increased by around 3,8 million items, and over 90 % of such increase was in tier 3 (around 3,6 million items). This resulted in a tilt of the relative importance of tier 3, which increased from 27 % to 39 % of total Union consumption.<alinea>

               <p>On the basis of the information collected, the Commission determined that, in the past, tier 1 tyres set the price benchmark for the others tiers. The main Union producers concentrated in tiers 1 and 2, where tyres were/are designed to have a long life cycle and to be retreadable. That justified significantly higher prices (and profit margins) for expected high performances for tiers 1 and 2 tyres. Consumers valued these physical and performance properties and were willing to pay higher prices for these properties. However, information available to the Commission showed that the above mentioned pricing trend changed and a &apos;reverse-cascading effect&apos; started with tier 3 prices inversely affecting tier 1. Of note, most of the low-priced imports relate to tier 3 where the Union producers suffered losses during the investigation period.</p>

            <recital xml:id="rec_d119e4041">
               <num>(208)</num>
               <p>Overall, the injury indicators show that the Union industry as a whole has been under intensive pressure. There was a reduction of production capacity, investment and employment over the period of investigation and a significant loss of market share despite decreasing sales prices. Market share was gained by imports of the product concerned at the expense of the Union industry, irrespective of segmentation, resulting in over 4200 jobs lost. While still around 14 % for the industry as a whole, profitability declined by 1,9 percentage points between 2014 and the IP and by 3 percentage points between 2015 and the IP. Moreover, the relative trend in profitability for the entire Union industry is also decreasing.</p>

               <num>(209)</num>
               <p>It was also provisionally established that Chinese imports were substantially undercutting the Union industry prices, which, in turn, pointed to a direct and significant impact on the deteriorating performance and declining capacity, production, employment and other injury indicators of the Union industry. The negative development was most felt in the tier 3 where many SMEs retreaders exited the market and could not benefit from the economic recovery in the sector, which was ultimately captured by the low-priced imports. It is recalled that the companies mostly active in tier 3 account for around 20 % of the total Union production. The losses of tier 3 are not sustainable and put the survival of the entire retreading activity in the Union at risk.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d119e4056">
               <num>(210)</num>
               <p>Moreover, the effects of the price pressure also affected the prices of the higher tiers. The growing price pressure from tier 3 tyres resulting from low-priced imports, mostly relating to tier 3 tyres, has triggered a similar development in tier 2, where sales prices fell by 12 % in the period considered, and even the prices for tier 1 tyres had to be lowered by 9 % to remain competitive.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d119e4063">
               <num>(211)</num>
               <p>Indeed, given the price interconnection between the tiers, even the best-performing tier 1 was suffering from the reverse-cascading price pressure across the three tiers explained in the previous chapter. This resulted in industrial depletion, loss of value throughout the supply chain of all three tiers, and degradation of the quality of the tyres available on the Union market. Moreover, the intense price competition in all three tiers has negative consequences for the capacity utilisation and leads to rising stocks of the industry (Table 12), coupled with less cash flow and investments (Table 13). Finally, the loss of the retreading industry in the Union also affects the profitability that the companies active in tier 1 and 2 can achieve.</p>

               <p>In addition, the complainants alleged that there was a risk of further aggravation of injury. In their view, numerous measures have been imposed in other import export markets which could cause immediate trade diversion. Moreover, the Union producers are said to be under threat on their export markets, as some countries such as Turkey had initiated a safeguard investigation. The risk of aggravation would also be linked to massive overcapacities in the PRC, where unused capacities represent about 40 % of current Chinese exports. The complainants further feared a structural impact on the EU market of tyres as the additional cost to purchase a high-quality tyre would become less and less possible to justify when the option of multiple retreading of a high-quality tyre disappears together with the retreading industry. Finally, they foresee a continuous improvement of tyres from the PRC. If higher-quality tyres from the PRC were allowed to compete with Union tyres at dumped prices, this would reduce the Union tyre industry margins and hence its capacity to invest and innovate. This, in turn, would likely force the Union industry to rely on lower quality tyres requiring limited investment in R &amp; D, further affecting their retreadability.</p>

               <p>Chinese exporters managed to increase significantly its market share at the expense of the Union industry. During the investigation period, the majority of the total volume of dumped Chinese imports concentrates on tier 3, forcing several of Union producers in that tier, in particular SME retreaders, to exit the market. In addition, as explained in recital (137) the Commission established that such high volumes at dumped prices have affected the price setting. Previously, the price setting was driven by tier 1, i.e. tier 2 prices were established in relation to tier 1 and tier 3 in relation to tier 2. Now this was reversed: tier 2 price is established on the basis of tier 3 and tier 1 on the basis of tier 2. This resulted in a decrease of selling prices in all tiers. The Commission thus provisionally concluded that the surge of dumped imports from the PRC had a determining role in the material injury suffered by the Union industry.</p>

               <p>Imports from other third countries showed a slight increase of their market share from 10,8 % to 11,9 % in the period considered. Out of all imports from other third countries, only Russian imports had average prices similar to those of Chinese imports. The average prices of imports of the product concerned were clearly higher than the average prices of Chinese imports. The market share of imports of the product concerned from Russia increased from 0,9 % to 1,3 % in the period considered. However, the limited quantities of Russian imports do not break the causal link between the dumped imports and the injury suffered by the Union industry.</p>

               <p>Based on Eurostat, export volumes decreased by 2,6 % during the period considered. Average export prices are affected by transfer values to related companies.

               <p>As mentioned in recital (181), the total costs of the Union industry decreased by EUR 12 per tyre over the period considered due to the evolution of the main raw materials (namely natural and synthetic rubber). However, the average selling price of the Union industry decreased by EUR 19 per tyre due to the price pressure of the dumped Chinese imports.</p>

               <p>The considerable price and volume pressure exerted on the Union industry by the increasing dumped imports from the country concerned over the period considered have not allowed the Union industry to benefit from the post-crisis growing Union market. Indeed, the fiercest competition takes place in tier 3, where most of the Chinese imports take place, also affecting the higher tiers as explained in recitals (204) to (210). The analysis of the injury indicators above shows that the economic situation of the Union industry as a whole has been affected by an increase of low-priced dumped imports from PRC that undercut substantially the Union prices. Chinese exporters managed to gain significant market share at the expense of the Union industry, resulting in a decrease of employment and a reduction of production capacity. The Union industry lost 5,2 percentage points of its market share between 2014 and the investigation period, and the sales volumes stagnated, while the consumption increased in the Union market. Moreover, the trend in profitability for the entire Union industry is also decreasing, suffering loses in particular in tier 3 tyres.</p>

               <p>The Commission distinguished and separated the effects of all known factors on the situation of the Union industry from the injurious effects of the dumped imports. The effect of the other identified factors namely imports from other third countries, the export sales performance of the Union producers and the costs evolution on the Union industry&apos;s negative developments in terms of market share, prices and profitability were not found to break the causal link. Even when their combined effect was considered, the Commission&apos;s conclusion was not different: in the absence of the dumped imports, the Union industry would not have been negatively affected to such a significant extent. In particular, the market share would not have dropped to such levels and employment would have been maintained.</p>

               <p>The effect of the potential anti-dumping measures is likely to be positive for the Union producers and in particular for SMEs. They would be able to benefit from the growing consumption and a market governed by fair conditions. It is especially expected that under these conditions Union producers would be able to increase their sales and thus regain part of the market share lost. This would in turn further increase the Union production and the capacity utilisation rate. In fair conditions, the Union industry would be able to increase their prices and improve their financial situation.</p>

               <p>For both sampled importers, the Chinese imports of the product concerned represented a significant share of the turnover in the investigation period. Their business model is mainly based on contracts with Chinese exporting producers, although they also have alternative sources (either domestically or from other third countries). Therefore, while measures would have an impact on their activity, it is also expected that the imposition of the measures will increase the prices in the Union market to fair levels.</p>

               <p>There is another business model that relies on a &apos;container only trading strategy&apos;. In this case, importers have more flexibility to change sources of supply. Three of the non-sampled importers fall under this category, representing less than 2 % of the total Chinese imports in the investigation period. Such a low level of cooperation suggests that the imposition of measures would not have any significant impact on their activity.</p>

               <p>Retreading is crucial for a virtuous circular economy. In addition to guaranteeing a high standard of reliability, performance and safety, retreads represent a great advantage also from an environmental point of view (less use of raw materials and energy, less production of CO<sub>2</sub>, pollution and less water consumption). This would therefore also contribute to the achievement of such larger societal goals, goals recognised by specific Union policies.</p>

               <p>Several interested parties underlined that premium tyre manufacturers are producing new high quality tyres which are designed to have along life cycle and can be retreaded. Without the retreading industry, the competition in the tyre industry will end up in a race to the bottom, resulting in industrial depletion, loss of value throughout the supply chain and minimise the quality of the offer in the Union.</p>

               <p>AIRP stated that the retreading activity is an example of a circular economy as the retreading of a single tyre compared with the production of a new tire uses 70 % less raw materials, 65 % less energy and 19 % less water, produces 37 % less CO<sub>2</sub> and 21 % less air pollution (particles), and causes 29 % less soil erosion in countries where natural rubber is produced.</p>

               <p>Moreover, the retreading industry currently prevents the creation of around 240000 tons of worn-out tyres yearly. Accordingly, measures that protect high quality tyres in the Union that are retreadable imposed against essentially one-use tyres would also contribute to the avoidance of waste in line with the objectives of the Waste Directive, as they would support the maintenance of a viable retreading business in the Union.</p>

               <p>According to studies carried out by AIRP, Italy saves an average of 30 million litres of crude oil annually through retreading, as well as over 20000 tons of other strategic raw materials such as natural and synthetic rubber, black smoke, textile fibres, steel and copper, besides reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emission by 10202 tons. According to the same studies, each retreaded tyre reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 26,5 kg.</p>

               <p>Accordingly, measures that protect high quality tyres in the Union that are retreadable imposed against essentially single-use tyres would also foster policy coherence with the Union objectives on waste reduction and circular economy, as they would support the maintenance of a viable retreading business in the Union. Moreover, given that mostly SMEs are active in this sector, they would also be in line with the important Commission objective to support these companies.</p>

            <p>Conclusion on Union interest</p>

               <num>(250)</num>
               <p>The effects of the anti-dumping measures on the Union producers would be positive. In spite of the claims of a potential negative impact on Union importers, the duty would still not be disproportionate in view of global effects on the whole Union industry. In fact, it is considered that the free available capacity in the Union industry and the imports from other countries would mitigate the risks by offering alternative sources of supply. The restoration of fair competition and of a level playing field, in the absence of dumped imports, would benefit the healthy development of the overall Union tyre market and foster policy coherence with the objectives of a circular economy, waste avoidance and the protection of SMEs in the Union. On those grounds, there are no compelling reasons against the imposition of provisional measures on imports of tyres for buses and lorries from the PRC.</p>

               <p>Therefore, the imposition of anti-dumping measures can be expected to enable the Union industry to stay in the market and following that to improve its situation. There is a high risk that should measure not be imposed, the Union industry would have to consider withdrawing from the retreaded tyre business in the medium term, resulting in inevitable job losses &#45; as has already occurred with the closure of dozens of SMEs as set out in recital (175). From the perspective of importers or users, no compelling reasons were identified against the imposition of anti-dumping measures on imports of tyres for buses and lorries originating from the PRC at this stage of the investigation.</p>

               <p>The injury would be eliminated if the Union industry was able to cover its costs of production and to obtain a profit before tax on sales of the like product in the Union market that could be reasonably achieved under normal conditions of competition by an industry of this type in the sector, namely in the absence of dumped imports. This target profit was established on the basis of the profit reached by the Union industry in 2014. Out of the period considered, this was considered the year in the period considered that resembled most normal conditions of competition because the volume of Chinese imports was the lowest and the average import price was the highest.</p>

               <p>According to the Harmonised System Explanatory Notes (HSEN) to headings 8708 and 8716, road, trailer and semi-trailer wheels fitted with tyres are to be classified in headings 8708 and 8716. As there might be a risk that operators use the import of wheels fitted with Chinese tyres to circumvent the measures, the Commission considered it appropriate to monitor imports of such wheels in order to minimise that risk. Information collected under that monitoring scheme could also be used should an anti-circumvention investigation under Article 13 of the basic Regulation need to be triggered in the future. Therefore, separate TARIC codes should be established for imports of road, trailer and semi-trailer wheels fitted with pneumatic tyres, new or retreaded, of rubber, of a kind used for buses or lorries, with a load index exceeding 121.</p>

               <p>To ensure a proper enforcement of the anti-dumping duties, the anti-dumping duty for all other companies should apply not only to the non-cooperating exporting producers in this investigation, but to the producers which did not have exports to the Union during the investigation period.</p>

            <p>FORM OF THE MEASURES</p>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d119e5435">
               <num>(269)</num>
               <p>The Commission found that <i>ad valorem</i> duty has two major disadvantages. First, an <i>ad valorem</i> duty creates an incentive for a company to sell its lower-end of its product mix. This would create additional pressure in tier 3, although it is precisely that tier of the market which needs the most protection against fierce unfair competition. Therefore, the Commission considered it more appropriate to fix a duty for tier 3 tyres at a certain absolute level.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d119e5447">
               <num>(270)</num>
               <p>Second, an <i>ad valorem</i> duty could also lead to fairly high amounts in the high price tier of tier 1 and tier 2 tyres. Here, the risk is that such high-quality tyres could become too expensive, although it is exactly those tyres which may be beneficial to the Union retreading business. The Union retreaders need suitable casings, which could be either provided by Union tier 1 or tier 2 producers, or by some Chinese exporters in that tier. If the measures over-sanction tier 1 and tier 2 imports into the Union, the Union policy goals of a circular economy may be negatively impacted.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d119e5456">
               <num>(271)</num>
               <p>Accordingly, the Commission provisionally considered that Union interest grounds speak in favour of imposing fixed duties per item, calculated on the basis of the individual injury margin for each exporter. Such fixed duties would remedy the risk of insufficiently addressing the dumping in tier 3, as tier 3 tyres are imported into the Union in large quantities and would pay a relatively high fixed duty when compared to their actual value. At the same time, such duties respond to the risk of over penalising tier 1 and tier 2 imports into the Union, which are retreadable and can be retreaded by the Union retreaders.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d119e5462">
               <num>(272)</num>
               <p>In conclusion the Commission found it appropriate to impose provisional duties in the form of fixed duties.</p>
