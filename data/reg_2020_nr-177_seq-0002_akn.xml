               <p>The purpose of this Regulation is to facilitate the uptake of water reuse whenever it is appropriate and cost-efficient, thereby creating an enabling framework for those Member States who wish or need to practise water reuse. Water reuse is a promising option for many Member States, but currently only a small number of them practice water reuse and have adopted national legislation or standards in that regard. This Regulation should be flexible enough to allow the continuation of the practice of water reuse and at the same time to ensure that it is possible for other Member States to apply those rules when they decide to introduce this practice at a later stage. Any decision not to practise water reuse should be duly justified based on the criteria laid down in this Regulation and reviewed regularly.</p>

               <p>Directive 2000/60/EC provides Member States with the necessary flexibility to include supplementary measures in the programmes of measures that they adopt to support their efforts to achieve the water quality objectives established by that Directive. The non-exclusive list of supplementary measures provided for in Part B of Annex VI to Directive 2000/60/EC contains, among others, water reuse measures. In this context and in line with a hierarchy of measures that could be considered by the Member States in managing water scarcity and droughts and that encourages measures ranging from water saving to water pricing policy and alternative solutions, and taking due account of the cost-benefit dimension, the minimum requirements for water reuse, as established by this Regulation, should be applicable whenever treated urban waste water from urban waste water treatment plants is reused, in accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC, for agricultural irrigation.</p>

               <p>Reuse of properly treated waste water, for example from urban waste water treatment plants, is considered to have a lower environmental impact than other alternative water supply methods, such as water transfers or desalination. However, such water reuse, which could reduce water wastage and save water, is practised only to a limited extent in the Union. This appears to be partly due to the significant cost of waste water reuse systems and the lack of common Union environmental and health standards for water reuse, and, as regards, in particular, agricultural products, due to the potential health and environmental risks and potential obstacles to the free movement of such products which have been irrigated with reclaimed water.</p>

               <p>Health standards in relation to food hygiene for agricultural products irrigated with reclaimed water can be achieved only if quality requirements for reclaimed water intended for agricultural irrigation do not differ significantly between the Member States. Harmonisation of requirements would also contribute to the efficient functioning of the internal market in relation to such products. It is therefore appropriate to introduce minimum levels of harmonisation by setting minimum requirements for water quality and monitoring. Those minimum requirements should consist of minimum parameters for reclaimed water that are based on the technical reports of the Commission&apos;s Joint Research Centre and reflect international standards on water reuse, and other stricter or additional quality requirements imposed, if necessary, by competent authorities together with any relevant preventive measures.</p>

               <p>Water reuse for agricultural irrigation can also contribute to the promotion of the circular economy by recovering nutrients from the reclaimed water and applying them to crops, by means of fertigation techniques. Thus, water reuse could potentially reduce the need for supplemental applications of mineral fertiliser. End-users should be informed about the nutrient content of reclaimed water.</p>

               <p>Risk management should comprise the identification and management of risks in a proactive way, and should incorporate the concept of producing reclaimed water of a specific quality required for particular uses. Risk assessment should be based on key elements of risk management and should identify any additional water quality requirements necessary to ensure sufficient protection of the environment and of human and animal health. For that purpose, water reuse risk management plans should ensure that reclaimed water is safely used and managed and that there are no risks to the environment or to human or animal health. In order to develop such risk management plans, existing international guidance or standards, such as ISO 20426:2018 Guidelines for health risk assessment and management for non-potable water reuse, ISO 16075:2015 Guidelines for treated waste water use for irrigation projects, or World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines could be used.</p>

For the purposes of compliance with the minimum requirements laid down under this Regulation and with any additional conditions set by the competent authority, reclamation facility operators should monitor the quality of reclaimed water.

               <p>This Regulation should cover reclaimed water which is obtained from waste water that has been collected in collecting systems, that has been treated in urban waste water treatment plants in accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC and that undergoes further treatment, either in the urban waste water treatment plant or in a reclamation facility, in order to meet the parameters set out in Annex I to this Regulation. In accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC, agglomerations of less than 2000 population equivalent (p.e.) do not have to be provided with a collecting system. However, urban waste water from agglomerations of less than 2000 p.e. that enters a collecting system should be subject to appropriate treatment before being discharged into fresh water or estuaries, in accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC. In that context, waste water from agglomerations of less than 2000 p.e. should fall under the scope of this Regulation only when it enters a collecting system and is subject to treatment in an urban waste water treatment plant. Similarly, this Regulation should not concern biodegradable industrial waste water from plants belonging to the industrial sectors listed in Annex III to Directive 91/271/EEC, unless the waste water from those plants enters a collecting system and is subject to treatment in an urban waste water treatment plant.</p>

The reclamation facility operators and the end-users should cooperate to ensure that reclaimed water produced in accordance with the minimum quality requirements established by this Regulation meets the needs of the end-users regarding crop categories. In cases where the quality classes of the water produced by the reclamation facility operators are not compatible with the crop category and irrigation method already in place in the area served, for example in a collective supply system, water quality requirements could be met by using, at a subsequent stage, several water treatment options alone or in combination with non-treatment options for the reclaimed water, in line with the multi-barrier approach.</p>

Production and supply of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation should therefore only be permitted on the basis of a permit, granted by competent authorities of Member States. In order to ensure a harmonised approach at Union level, traceability of reclaimed water and transparency, the substantive rules for such permits should be laid down at Union level. However, the details of the procedures for granting permits, such as the designation of the competent authorities and deadlines, should be determined by Member States. Member States should be able to apply existing procedures for granting permits, which should be adapted to take account of the requirements introduced by this Regulation.

               <p>Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 lays down general rules for food business operators and covers the production, processing, distribution and placing on the market of food intended for human consumption. That Regulation addresses the health quality of food and one of its main principles is that the primary responsibility for food safety is borne by the food business operator. That Regulation is also supported by detailed guidance. In this regard, the Commission notice on guidance document on addressing microbiological risks in fresh fruits and vegetables at primary production through good hygiene is of particular relevance. The minimum requirements for reclaimed water laid down in this Regulation do not preclude food business operators from obtaining the water quality required to comply with Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 using, at a subsequent stage, several water treatment options alone or in combination with non-treatment options.</p>
