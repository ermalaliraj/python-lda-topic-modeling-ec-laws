                     <p>Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote>, which was repealed by Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">
                     <p>Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007 (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 671).</p>
                  </authorialNote>, the Commission was empowered to fix refunds when considered necessary in accordance with the criteria and requirements established in Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Against this background, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 689/2013<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">
                     <p>Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 689/2013 of 18 July 2013 fixing the export refunds on poultrymeat (OJ L 196, 19.7.2013, p. 13).</p>
                  </authorialNote> was adopted.</p>

               <p>By its judgment of 20 September 2017<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">
                     <p>Judgment of 20 September 2017, Tilly-Sabco/Commission (C-183/16 P) ECLI:EU:C:2017:704.</p>
                  </authorialNote>, the Court of Justice annulled Implementing Regulation (EU) No 689/2013. The Court of Justice held that the failure to comply with the procedural rules relating to the adoption of an act adversely affecting a person constitutes an infringement of an essential procedural requirement and that, therefore, the act vitiated by such a defect must be annulled.</p>

            <recital xml:id="rec_d269e113">
               <num>(3)</num>
               <p>The Court of Justice also ruled that notwithstanding the breach of essential procedural requirements, no error had been disclosed affecting the conformity of the act, which contained the measures necessary for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Thus, for the sake of legal certainty and to avoid adversely affecting the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, it held that the effects of the contested Regulation be maintained until the entry into force of a new act intended to replace it.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d269e119">
               <num>(4)</num>
               <p>Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 repealed the procedural provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 concerning the adoption of acts fixing refunds. Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 applies since 1 January 2014.</p>

               <num>(5)</num>
               <p>It is therefore necessary to fix the export refunds on poultrymeat at the same level as they were fixed by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 689/2013, in order to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice. This Regulation should thus apply retroactively for the period between 19 July 2013 and 31 December 2013.</p>

                  </authorialNote>. The expiration of the effects of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 689/2013 would therefore imply, inter alia, that Regulation (EU) No 360/2013 be applicable. For the sake of legal certainty, Regulation (EU) No 360/2013 should therefore be repealed,</p>
