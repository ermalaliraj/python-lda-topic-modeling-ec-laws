               <p>It is incumbent upon the Council to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as appropriate. Pursuant to Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, fishing opportunities are to be fixed in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) set out in Article 2(2) of that Regulation. Pursuant to Article 16(1) of that Regulation, fishing opportunities allocated to Member States are to ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each Member State for each fish stock or fishery.</p>

               <p>The total allowable catch (TAC) should therefore be established, in line with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, on the basis of available scientific advice, taking into account biological and socio-economic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders, in particular at the meetings of the advisory councils.</p>

               <p>Pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the landing obligation applies fully from 1 January 2019 and all species subject to catch limits are to be landed. Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 provides that, when the landing obligation in respect of a fish stock is introduced, fishing opportunities are to be fixed taking into account the change from fixing fishing opportunities that reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches. On the basis of the joint recommendations submitted by the Member States and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the Commission adopted a number of delegated regulations laying down details for the implementation of the landing obligation in the form of specific discard plans.</p>

               <p>The fishing opportunities for stocks of species falling under the landing obligation should take into account the fact that discarding is in principle no longer allowed. Therefore, the fishing opportunities should be based on the advice figure for total catches (instead of the advice figure for wanted catches), as provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The quantities that, by way of exception from the landing obligation, may continue to be discarded should be deducted from that advice figure for total catches.</p>

               <p>There are certain stocks for which ICES has issued scientific advice for no catches. If TACs for those stocks are established at the level indicated in the scientific advice, the obligation to land all catches, including by-catches from those stocks, in mixed fisheries would lead to the phenomenon of &apos;choke species&apos;. In order to strike the right balance between continuing fisheries in view of the potentially severe socio-economic implications, and the need to achieve a good biological status for those stocks, taking into account the difficulty of fishing all stocks in a mixed fishery at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) at the same time, it is appropriate to establish specific TACs for by-catches for those stocks. The level of those TACs should be such that mortality for those stocks is decreased and that it provides incentives for improvements in selectivity and avoidance.</p>

                     <p>Regulation (EU) 2019/472 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2019 establishing a multiannual plan for stocks fished in the Western Waters and adjacent waters, and for fisheries exploiting those stocks, amending Regulations (EU) 2016/1139 and (EU) 2018/973, and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007 and (EC) No 1300/2008 (OJ L 83, 25.3.2019, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote> (&apos;the Western Waters multiannual plan&apos;), the target fishing mortality, in line with the ranges of F<sub>MSY</sub> defined in Article 2 of that Regulation, was to be achieved as soon as possible, and on a progressive and incremental basis by 2020 for the stocks listed in Article 1(1) of that Regulation and is to be maintained thereafter within the ranges of F<sub>MSY</sub>, in accordance with Article 4 of that Regulation. The overall fishing mortality for European seabass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>) in ICES divisions 8a and 8b should therefore be set in line with MSY, taking into account commercial and recreational catches and including discards (3108 tonnes altogether according to the ICES advice). Member States are to take appropriate measures to ensure that the fishing mortality from their fleets and from their recreational fishermen does not exceed F<sub>MSY</sub> point value, as required by Article 4(3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/472.</p>

               <p>Measures for recreational fisheries for European seabass should also be continued, taking account of the significant impact of such fisheries on the stocks concerned. Within the limits of the scientific advice, the bag limits should be continued. Considering the lack of sufficient selectivity and that higher number of specimens are likely to be caught than the established limits, fixed nets should be excluded. Having considered environmental, social and economic circumstances, and especially the dependency of commercial fishermen on those stocks in coastal communities, those measures for European seabass would strike an appropriate balance between the interests of commercial and recreational fishermen. In particular, those measures would allow recreational fishermen to exercise their fishing activities by taking into account their impact on those stocks.</p>

               <p>As regards the European eel (<i>Anguilla anguilla</i>) stock, ICES has advised that all anthropogenic mortalities, including those due to recreational and commercial fisheries, should be reduced to zero, or kept as close to zero as possible. Moreover, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) adopted Recommendation GFCM/42/2018/1 establishing management measures for European eel in the Mediterranean. It is appropriate to maintain the level-playing field across the Union and hence to maintain also for the Union waters of the ICES area as well as brackish waters such as estuaries, coastal lagoons and transitional waters a consecutive three-month closure period for all fisheries of European eel at all life stages.

               <p>For some years, certain TACs for stocks of elasmobranchs (skates, sharks, rays) have been set at zero, with a linked provision establishing an obligation to immediately release accidental catches. The reason for that specific treatment was the poor conservation status of those stocks and the assumption that discarding, because of high survival rates, would not raise fishing mortality rates and would be beneficial for the conservation of those species. As of 1 January 2019, however, catches of those species have to be landed, unless they are covered by any of the derogations from the landing obligation provided for in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Point (a) of Article 15(4) of that Regulation allows such derogations for species in respect of which fishing is prohibited and which are identified as such in a Union legal act adopted in the area of the CFP. Therefore, it is appropriate to prohibit fishing of those species in the areas concerned.</p>

In addition, it prohibited fishing activities in the area where redfish aggregates in order to minimise by-catches. That NEAFC measure, based on the ICES advice for zero catches, should be implemented in Union law. The NEAFC was not able to adopt a recommendation for redfish in ICES subareas 1 and 2.

               <p>ICES advice for 2021 indicates that the stocks of cod and whiting in the Celtic Sea are below B<sub>lim</sub>. Specific remedial measures were already taken for those stocks pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2020/123. The purpose of those measures was to contribute to the recovery of the stocks concerned. The measures for cod aim at improving selectivity by making the usage of gear that has lower levels of by-catches of cod mandatory in the areas where cod catches are significant, thus decreasing the fishing mortality of that stock in mixed fisheries. The measures for whiting consist of technical modifications to characteristics of gear to decrease by-catches of whiting. In accordance with Article 8 of the Western Waters multiannual plan, where scientific advice indicates that the spawning stock biomass of any of the stocks referred to in Article 1(1) of that plan is below B<sub>lim</sub>, further remedial measures are to be taken to ensure the rapid return of the stock to levels above the level capable of producing MSY. In particular, those remedial measures may include suspending the targeted fishery for the stock concerned and the adequate reduction of fishing opportunities for those stocks or other stocks in the fisheries that have by-catches of cod or whiting.</p>
