               <p>In Regulation (EU) 2018/120, the total allowable catch (TAC) for sandeel in ICES divisions 2a and 3a and ICES subarea 4 was set at zero. Sandeel is a short-lived species and the relevant scientific advice becomes available in the second half of February, while fishing activities start in April.</p>

               <p>The catch limits for sandeel in ICES divisions 2a and 3a and ICES subarea 4 should now be amended in line with the latest scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), issued on 23 February 2018.</p>

               <p>For sandeel fisheries, ICES divisions 2a and 3a and ICES subarea 4 are divided into management areas, on the basis of scientific advice. Management area 3r is mainly located in Norwegian waters. However, it also includes Union waters, and some important fishing banks straddled across management areas 2r and 3r. ICES advice sets out that on average 8 % of catches in management area 3r are taken in Union waters. Catch limits for Union waters of management area 3r should be established in accordance with that advice.</p>

The provisions introduced by this Regulation concerning catch limits should therefore also apply from that date. Such retroactive application is without prejudice to the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations as the fishing opportunities concerned have not yet been exhausted,</p>
