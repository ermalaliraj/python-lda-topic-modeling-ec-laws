               <p>The Schengen Information System (SIS) constitutes an essential tool for the application of the provisions of the Schengen <i>acquis</i> as integrated into the framework of the European Union. SIS is one of the major compensatory measures contributing to maintaining a high level of security within the area of freedom, security and justice of the Union by supporting operational cooperation between national competent authorities, in particular border guards, the police, customs authorities, immigration authorities, and authorities responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences or execution of criminal penalties.</p>

               <p>The fact that the legal basis for SIS consists of separate instruments does not affect the principle that SIS constitutes one single information system that should operate as such. It should include a single network of national offices called SIRENE Bureaux for ensuring the exchange of supplementary information. Certain provisions of those instruments should therefore be identical.</p>

It is also necessary to determine the categories of data to be entered into the system, the purposes for which the data are to be entered and processed and the criteria for their entry. Rules are also required to govern the deletion of alerts, the authorities authorised to access the data, the use of biometric data and to further determine data protection and data processing rules.</p>

               <p>SIS includes a central system (Central SIS) and national systems. The national systems might contain a complete or partial copy of the SIS database, which may be shared by two or more Member States. Considering that SIS is the most important information exchange instrument in Europe for ensuring security and effective border management, it is necessary to ensure its uninterrupted operation at central as well as at national level. The availability of SIS should be subject to close monitoring at central and Member State level and any incident of unavailability for end-users should be registered and reported to stakeholders at national and Union level. Each Member State should set up a backup for its national system. Member States should also ensure uninterrupted connectivity with Central SIS by having duplicated and physically and geographically separated connection points. Central SIS and the Communication Infrastructure should be operated in such a way that their functioning 24 hours a day, 7 days a week is ensured. For that reason, the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (&apos;eu-LISA&apos;) established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1726 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="8">

SIRENE Bureaux should be involved in the development of training programmes.

The Commission should report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the data quality issues encountered. To further increase the quality of data in SIS, eu-LISA should also offer training on the use of SIS to national training bodies and, insofar as possible, to the SIRENE Bureaux and to end-users.</p>

Therefore, a central repository should be established. Statistics retained in or obtained from that repository should not contain any personal data.

               <p>This Regulation should set mandatory rules for the consultation and notification of national authorities where a third-country national holds or might obtain a valid residence permit or long-stay visa granted in one Member State, and another Member State intends to or has already entered an alert for refusal of entry and stay on that third-country national. Such situations create serious uncertainties for border guards, police and immigration authorities. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide for a mandatory timeframe for rapid consultation with a definite result in order to ensure that third-country nationals who are entitled to reside lawfully in the territory of the Member States are entitled to enter that territory without difficulty and that those who are not entitled to enter are prevented from doing so.</p>

               <p>This Regulations introduces a series of improvements to SIS which will increase its effectiveness, strengthen data protection and extend access rights. Certain of those improvements do not require complex technical developments, while others do require technical changes of varying magnitude. In order to enable improvements to the system to become available to end-users as soon as possible, this Regulation introduces amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 in several phases. A number of improvements to the system should apply immediately upon entry into force of this Regulation, whereas others should apply either one or two years after its entry into force. This Regulation should apply in its entirety within three years after its entry into force. In order to avoid delays in its application the phased implementation of this Regulation should be closely monitored.</p>
