               <p>In order to ensure a sufficient and uninterrupted supply of certain agricultural and industrial products which are unavailable in the Union and thereby avoid any disturbances on the market for those products, autonomous Common Customs Tariff (&apos;CCT&apos;) duties on those products have been suspended by Council Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="1">
                     <p>Council Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 of 17 December 2013 suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural and industrial products and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011 (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 201).</p>

               <p>The Union production of 97 products that are not listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 is inadequate or non-existent. It is therefore in the interest of the Union to suspend totally the autonomous CCT duties on those products.</p>

               <p>It is necessary to modify the conditions for the suspension of autonomous CCT duties for 47 products listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 in order to take into account technical product developments and economic trends on the market.</p>

The suspensions for those products should therefore be deleted. Moreover, with a view to promoting integrated battery production in the Union and in accordance with the communication from the Commission entitled &apos;Europe on the Move &#45; Sustainable Mobility for Europe: safe, connected, and clean&apos;, the suspensions for 20 additional products listed in that Annex should be withdrawn. Furthermore, another 50 suspensions should be deleted from that Annex as a result of the implementation of the agreement in the form of the Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">
