Moreover, experience from the negotiations of the programmes has shown that the rules for the joint setting up of young farmers and the thresholds for access to support required under Article 19(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 should be clarified, and that the provisions on the duration of the business plan should be streamlined.</p>

               <p>In order to be sufficiently attractive to the private sector, it is essential that financial instruments are designed and implemented in a flexible and transparent manner. However, experience has shown that certain measure-specific eligibility rules limit the uptake of financial instruments in the rural development programmes, as well as the flexible use of financial instruments by fund managers. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide that certain measure-specific eligibility rules do not apply to financial instruments. For the same reason, it is also appropriate to provide that start-up aid to young farmers under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 may also be provided in the form of financial instruments. In view of those changes, it should be provided that, where support for investments under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 is granted in the form of financial instruments, the investment must contribute to one or more Union priorities for rural development.</p>

               <p>Nowadays farmers are exposed to increasing economic risks as a consequence of market developments. However, those economic risks do not affect all agricultural sectors equally. Consequently, Member States should have the possibility, in duly justified cases, to help farmers by means of a sector-specific income stabilisation tool, in particular for sectors affected by a severe income drop, which would have a significant economic impact for a specific rural area, provided that the drop in income exceeds a threshold of at least 20 %. In order to ensure that the sector-specific income stabilisation tool is effective and adapted to Member States&apos; specific circumstances, it should be possible for them to define, in their rural development programmes, the income to be taken into account for the activation of the tool, in a flexible manner. At the same time, and in order to promote the use of insurance by farmers, the threshold for the drop in production applicable for insurance should be reduced to 20 %. In addition, in order to monitor the expenditure made under the sector-specific income stabilisation tool and insurance, the content of the financial plan of the programme should be adapted.</p>

               <p>With regard to mutual funds for farmers of all sectors, it appears that the prohibition of any contribution by public funds to initial capital stock laid down in Article 38(3) and Article 39(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 hinders the effective functioning of those funds. That prohibition should therefore be deleted.

               <p>As experience acquired in the past showed that support was in a number of cases granted to natural or legal persons whose business purpose was not, or was only marginally, targeted at an agricultural activity, Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 introduced the active farmer clause. Pursuant thereto, Member States are to refrain from granting direct payments to certain persons unless such persons can demonstrate that their agricultural activity is not marginal. However, subsequent experience shows that implementing the three criteria for being regarded as an active farmer, listed in the third subparagraph of Article 9(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, has proven difficult for many Member States. In order to reduce the administrative burden associated with the implementation of those three criteria, Member States should have the possibility to decide that only one or two of them are made available to demonstrate that a person is an active farmer.</p>

               <p>Given the potential for indirect environmental benefits for biodiversity that may be provided by certain permanent crops, the list of ecological focus area types set out in Article 46 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 should be extended to include <i>Miscanthus</i> and <i>Silphium perfoliatum</i>. Considering that the type of vegetation coverage may positively affect the biodiversity contribution of land lying fallow, land lying fallow for melliferous plants should be recognised as a distinct ecological focus area type. Consequently, weighting factors should be established for <i>Miscanthus</i>, <i>Silphium perfoliatum</i> and land lying fallow for melliferous plants. Weighting factors should be established in such a way as to reflect their different importance for biodiversity. The introduction of additional ecological focus area types requires the existing weighting factors for areas with nitrogen-fixing crops and for areas with short rotation coppice to be adapted so as to reflect the new balance between all ecological focus area types.</p>

               <p>Producer organisations and their associations can play useful roles in concentrating supply, in improving the marketing, planning and adjusting of production to demand, optimising production costs and stabilising producer prices, carrying out research, promoting best practices and providing technical assistance, managing by-products and risk management tools available to their members, thereby contributing to strengthening the position of producers in the food chain. Their activities, including the contractual negotiations for the supply of agricultural products by such producer organisations and their associations when concentrating supply and placing the products of their members on the market, therefore contribute to the fulfilment of the objectives of the CAP set out in Article 39 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), since they strengthen the position of farmers in the food supply chain and can contribute to a better functioning of the food supply chain. The reform of the CAP in 2013 reinforced the role of producer organisations. By way of derogation from Article 101 TFEU, the possibility to carry out activities such as production planning, cost optimisation, placing producer members&apos; products on the market and conducting contractual negotiations should therefore be explicitly regulated as a right of recognised producer organisations in all sectors for which Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="10">

Competition authorities should have the right to intervene in such cases and decide that such activities should, for the future, be modified, discontinued or not take place at all.
