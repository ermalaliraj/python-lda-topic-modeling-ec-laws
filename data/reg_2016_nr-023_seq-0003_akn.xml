The complaint contained prima facie evidence of dumping of the said product and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation.</p>

It informed interested parties in the notice of initiation that it had provisionally chosen United Arab Emirates as a third market economy country (&apos;analogue country&apos;) within the meaning of Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation and invited comments on this choice.</p>

               <p>The Commission announced in the notice of initiation that it had provisionally selected a sample of Union producers. This sample initially consisted of four producers that were known to the Commission prior to the initiation of the investigation to produce HFP rebars in the Union. The Commission selected the sample on the basis of the sales volume to unrelated customers. Interested parties were also invited in the notice of initiation to make their views known on the provisional sample. No comment was received on the proposed sample. The sampled Union producers accounted for 90 % of the estimated total Union production. The sample is considered to be representative of the Union industry.</p>

               <p>The product subject to this investigation are high fatigue performance iron or steel concrete reinforcing bars and rods made of iron, non-alloy steel or alloy steel (but excluding of stainless steel, high-speed steel and silico-manganese steel), not further worked than hot-rolled, but including those twisted after rolling; these bars and rods contain indentations, ribs, grooves or other deformations produced during the rolling process or are twisted after rolling. The key characteristic of high fatigue performance is the ability to endure repeated stress without breaking and, specifically, the ability to resist in excess of 4,5 million fatigue cycles using a stress ratio (min/max) of 0,2 and a stress range exceeding 150 MPa.</p>

               <p>Six Chinese exporting producers belonging to three groups (Jiangyin Xicheng Group, Jiangsu Yonggang Group and Jiangsu Shagang Group) cooperated with the investigation.

               <p>Two of the cooperating groups, Jiangsu Yonggang and Jiangsu Shagang, are related through common ownership of one of the exporting producer of the HFP rebars, which was admitted in the questionnaire replies of both groups. However, the companies claimed that the two groups nevertheless should be treated as separate entities for the purpose of this investigation. The companies stressed, inter alia, no involvement in each other decision making processes, lack of operational link whatsoever, separate production lines and completely independent sales distribution channels in the domestic and international markets.</p>

               <p>With regard to this claim, taking into account the nature and strength of the relation between the groups, namely the fact that one of the companies of one group is the biggest single shareholder in the main producer of the product concerned of the second group, and that the former company&apos;s officials are present in the main statutory bodies of the latter company, the Commission preliminarily concludes that both groups should be treated as related. Thus, one weighted average provisional duty for the companies of the both groups shall be applied.</p>

               <p>The Commission also examined whether any other market economy country in which HFP rebars are produced, could constitute an appropriate analogue country. According to the information available to the Commission on the basis of the complaint, the submissions from the parties and Eurostat data, the other countries producing HFP rebars are Egypt, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, and Ukraine. In total 38 potential producers of the product concerned in these countries were contacted by the Commission.</p>

               <p>The cooperation was received from only one company located in South Africa.

               <p>With regard to the South African company in question, China Iron and Steel Association (&apos;CISA&apos;) an interested party in this procedure, raised the point that the company was a subsidiary of one of the EU producers who supported the complaint. According to CISA, the objectivity of any data provided by this company would be questionable.</p>

               <p>With regard to this claim it has to be first noted that the Commission was limited with its choice as to the analogue country due to lack of cooperation from other countries. Secondly, the relation between analogue country company and EU producer is irrelevant for the purpose of this investigation. The Commission notes that even if the producers in the analogue countries are related to Union producers, such a link does not invalidate or affect the determination of the normal value based on verified data, which was confirmed by the recent judgment of the Court of Justice in a similar case<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">
                     <p>C-687/13 of 10 September 2015, para 68.</p>
                  </authorialNote>. Furthermore, there is no specific reason for questioning the use of data of this analogue country producer which was properly verified. Furthermore, as far as South Africa is concerned, the domestic market for HFP rebars is relatively open, not protected by import custom duties with regard to product concerned, with internal competition of several domestic producers and imports having a sizeable market share of 13 %. The analogue country producer verified has extensive quantities of domestic and export sales, with a market share on its domestic market in a range of 13-23 %. It produces similar types of the like product to those exported to the Union by the Chinese producers.</p>

               <p>As mentioned in recital (24) above, the normal value for exporting producers in the PRC was determined on the basis of the constructed value in the analogue country, in this case South Africa, in accordance with Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation.</p>

               <p>For this determination, the Commission first examined whether the total volume of domestic sales of the like product to independent customers made by the cooperating producer in the analogue country was representative, i.e. whether the total volume of such domestic sales represented at least 5 % of the total volume of export sales of the product concerned of each of the respective Chinese cooperating exporters to the Union during the IP in accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. On this basis, it was found that the overall domestic sales in the analogue country were representative.</p>

               <num>(33)</num>
               <p>Subsequently the Commission made the same comparison for each product type, i.e. it was examined whether the domestic sales of a given type of the product in the analogue country were representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. On this basis, it was found that domestic sales in the analogue country were not representative for any of the product types with regard to any of the Chinese exporters.</p>

               <p>The normal value was thus constructed in line with Article 2(3) and (6) of the basic Regulation by adding to the average cost of manufacturing of the relevant product type the weighted average selling, general and administrative (&apos;SG&amp;A&apos;) expenses incurred (1 %-5 %) and the weighted average profit realised (10 %-20 %) by the producer in the analogue country on domestic sales, in the ordinary course of trade, during the investigation period.</p>

               <p>HFP rebars are used by fabricators who cut and bend the rebars to tailor-made shapes and lengths and deliver them to construction sites.

               <p>The distinction between captive and free market is relevant for the injury analysis because products destined for captive use are not exposed to direct competition from imports, and prices are set within the group and are therefore not reliable. By contrast, production destined for free market sale is in direct competition with imports of the product concerned, and prices are free market prices.</p>

               <p>To provide a picture of the Union industry that is as complete as possible, the Commission obtained data for the entire production of HFP rebars and determined whether the production was destined for captive use or for the free market. For some injury indicators relating to the Union industry, the Commission analysed separately data related to the free and the captive market and made a comparative analysis. These factors are: sales, market share, unit prices, unit cost, profitability, and cash flow. However, other economic indicators could meaningfully be examined only by referring to the whole activity, including the captive use of the Union industry because they depend on the whole activity, whether the production is captive or sold on the free market. These factors are: production, capacity, capacity utilisation, investments, return on investments, employment, productivity, stocks and labour costs. For these factors, analysis of the whole Union industry is warranted in order to establish a complete injury picture of the Union industry, as the data in question cannot be separated out between captive sales and free sales.</p>

               <p>The average import prices from China decreased during the period considered, in line with the decrease of worldwide prices of iron ore which is used as raw material in China and in the analogue country (see table in the recital (81) below). The import prices for the IP were established on the basis of the verified export sales prices from the sampled Chinese exporting producers. The average import prices for 2013 and 2014 were established on the basis of the Surveillance Database. The Commission took into account the long time-lag between the invoice dates and the customs clearance dates, which otherwise could have resulted in prices from different periods being compared with each other. The import prices from China remained below both the unrelated and related sales prices of the Union industry during the same period. As can be seen in recital (82) below, in 2013 the average related sale price of the Union industry was 483 EUR/tonne and the average unrelated sale price 456 EUR/tonne. In 2014, the average related sale price of the Union industry was 464 EUR/tonne and the average unrelated sale price 434 EUR/tonne. In the IP, the average related sale price of the Union industry was 458 EUR/tonne and the average unrelated sale price 427 EUR/tonne.</p>

               <p>In order to determine whether there was price undercutting during the IP, and to what extent, the weighted average sales prices per product type of the sampled Union producers charged to unrelated customers on the Union market, adjusted to an ex-works level by deducting the actual delivery costs, commissions and credit notes, were compared to the corresponding weighted average prices per product type of the dumped imports from the sampled Chinese producers to the first independent customer on the Union market, established on a CIF basis. As explained in recital (102) below, undercutting was established in comparison with unrelated sales only, since the comparison only took into account matching product types. The related sales were exclusively composed of product types not being imported from China.</p>

               <p>The result of the comparison, when expressed as a percentage of the sampled Union producers&apos; turnover during the IP, showed an undercutting margin of ranging from 1,7 % to 5,6 %. The lower prices of the dumped imports compared to the Union prices during the period considered explain the significant increase in Chinese import volume and in the market share held by the imports from China from 2013 onwards.</p>

               <p>For the purpose of the injury analysis, the Commission distinguished between macroeconomic and microeconomic injury indicators. In this regard, the economic situation of the Union industry is assessed on the basis of (a) macroeconomic indicators, namely production, production capacity, capacity utilisation, sales volume, market share and growth, employment, productivity, magnitude of the actual dumping margin and recovery from past dumping, for which the data was collected at the level of the total Union industry and on the basis of (b) microeconomic indicators, namely average unit prices, unit cost, profitability, cash flow, investments, return on investment and ability to raise capital, stocks and labour costs, for which the data was collected at the level of the sampled Union producers.</p>

The remaining injury indicators were established on the basis of all product types. Even if the remaining injury indicators would have been established on the basis of the comparable product types only, it would not have altered the trends observed.</p>

               <p>Since the same machinery can be used to manufacture both the like product and other types of rebars, production capacity and utilisation was calculated for all types of rebars. There is no specific machinery for HFP rebars that could be taken into account to calculate capacity and capacity utilisation for the like product only. Capacity and capacity utilisation remained constant during the period considered, despite increasing Union consumption. The decrease in the production volume of the product concerned was compensated by an increase in the production volume of other products.</p>

               <p>After an increase between 2011 and 2012, in the context of an increasing consumption, the sales volume to unrelated customers started to decrease from 2013 onwards, in parallel with the rapid increase of the dumped imports. This is also reflected in the upward trend of closing stocks, which increased overall by 27 % during the period considered and by 28 % from 2012 to the IP.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, the market share of unrelated sales by the Union industry decreased significantly by 18 percentage points since 2011 and by 22 percentage points since 2012, in the context of a steady increase in consumption. This shows that Union industry could not fully benefit from the growth in Union consumption due to the increasing market share of dumped imports.</p>

               <p>The related sales first decreased in 2013, at the same time with the start of the dumped imports from China, but then increased back to their previous level. The market share of the related sales decreased by 17 percentage points since 2011 and by 12 percentage points since 2012. However, the related sales took place in a captive market and were therefore only indirectly affected by the Chinese imports.</p>

               <p>Employment decreased from 253 in 2011 to 231 in 2012, and then further decreased to 209 in the IP. The employment in the Union industry was calculated by considering the number of employees working directly with the product concerned, when available, or by allocating total employment of the producers proportionally to the share of output of the product concerned. Productivity, measured as output in tonnes per person employed per year, increased by 15 % from 2011 to 2012. From 2012 to the IP, the productivity first fell in 2013 in line with the decreased output, but then regained its previous levels, suggesting that the Union industry made significant efforts to improve its efficiency while its production remained at the 2013 levels.<alinea>

               <p>The dumping margins of the sampled Chinese exporting producers are considerable (see recital (45) above). Given the sector of the product concerned, the volume, market share and prices of the dumped imports from China, discussed above, the impact on the Union industry of the actual dumping margin cannot be considered to be negligible.</p>

               <p>The average sales prices of the sampled Union producers to unrelated customers in the Union decreased by 16 % from 2012 to the IP. The price decrease reflects a general lowering trend in the worldwide cost of raw material, both shredded scrap used in the Union and iron ore used in China and in the analogue country, as shown in the table below.<alinea>

               <p>The profitability of the sampled Union producers was established separately for related and unrelated sales. Profitability was expressed as the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.</p>

               <p>For their related sales, the sampled Union producers were loss-making in 2011, but started to recover in 2012 in line with the increase in Union consumption. In 2012 a profit of +2,5 % on the related sales was made. The related sales became again loss-making from 2013 onwards. However, the related sales prices do not necessarily reflect market prices, since the prices are set in an agreement between related parties. The profits of related sales could therefore not be considered to reflect the profitability of the Union industry.</p>

               <p>Cash flow, which is the ability of the industry to self-finance its activities, was initially positive for unrelated sales but became negative since 2014, in line with the continuing losses. Cash flow from related sales was negative in 2011 but positive in the rest of the period considered. However, since the related sales prices do not necessarily reflect market prices, the cash flow from related sales could not be considered to reflect the cash flow situation of the Union industry.</p>

               <p>The evolution of profitability and cash flow during the period considered limited the ability of the sampled Union producers to invest in their activities and undermined their development. However, due to the nature of the industry, investments are used to manufacture various products, including products outside the scope of the investigation. For this reason it was not possible to directly establish investments and return on investment, which is profit in percentage of the net book value of investments, specifically for the product under investigation. Instead the overall investments of the industry were presumed to be allocated to the product concerned in line with share of turnover.</p>

               <num>(92)</num>
               <p>The investigation showed that the Union industry did not benefit from the increase in consumption during the period considered. Initially, from 2011 to 2012, there is no injury, not least because there were no imports, but subsequently, from 2013 onwards, its economic situation deteriorated when compared with the 2012 levels. Indeed, certain indicators such as production and sales volume of the Union industry stagnated despite a continued increase in Union consumption. The market share of the Union industry dropped significantly, since the increased Union consumption was met by the rapid increase of Chinese imports.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, certain injury indicators related to the financial performance, namely profitability and cash flow of the Union industry were seriously affected (drop of profitability by 4 percentage points) by the price pressure which prevailed in the Union market. The Union industry was not able to maintain its prices at a level necessary to reach a profitability in line with the year 2012 and became loss-making as a consequence.</p>

               <p>In accordance with Article 3(6) and (7) of the basic Regulation, the Commission examined whether the dumped imports from China had caused injury to the Union industry to a degree sufficient to be considered as material. Known factors other than the dumped imports, which could at the same time be injuring the Union industry, were also examined to ensure that the possible injury caused by these other factors was not attributed to the dumped imports.</p>

               <num>(96)</num>
               <p>The investigation showed that the Union consumption increased by 50 % over the period considered and at the same time the volume of imports originating in China increased significantly. As explained in recitals (58)-(59), the imports from China increased from zero in 2012 to 292000 tonnes in the IP. The increase of dumped imports coincided with a drastic drop in the market share of the Union industry: as explained in recitals (74)-(76), the Union industry&apos;s unrelated sales dropped from 319000 tonnes in 2012 to 261000 tonnes in the IP.</p>

               <num>(97)</num>
               <p>With regard to the price pressure prevailing on the Union market during the period considered, it was found that the average import prices from China remained constantly lower than the average sales prices of the Union industry. By undercutting the Union industry, Chinese imports increased their market share from zero in 2012 to 36 % of the Union consumption in the IP. In the free market, the market share of Chinese imports increased from zero in 2012 to 51 % in the IP. The market share of the Union industry in the free market decreased from 92 % in 2012 to 46 % in the IP. The loss in market share reveals that the Union industry could not benefit from the increased consumption.</p>

               <num>(98)</num>
               <p>Due to the price pressure exerted by the increasing volumes of Chinese imports, the Union industry was not able to cover its costs. The Union industry was loss-making in 2011, and narrowly profitable before the start of the dumping in 2012. The Union industry became loss-making from 2013 onwards, at the same time when the dumped imports started to enter the Union market.</p>

               <p>Based on the above, it is concluded that the surge of dumped imports from China at prices constantly undercutting those of the Union industry caused material injury suffered by the Union industry.</p>

               <p>There are hardly any exports by the Union industry. Exports to third countries decreased from 1 % to 0 % of sales during the period considered. It can be therefore concluded that the export activity of the Union industry could not be a cause of the material injury found.</p>

               <num>(101)</num>
               <p>Chinese exporters have alleged that the causal link is broken because the sales of one of the Union producers are almost exclusively made to related parties in a captive market. Thus any injury would be caused by low transfer prices set between related companies, not by the Chinese imports.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d331e2652">
               <num>(102)</num>
               <p>First, the Commission observes that only one of the Union producers in the sample sells in a captive market and furthermore also has non-captive sales of the like product.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d331e2658">
               <num>(103)</num>
               <p>Second, the investigation showed that the prices to related parties were higher than the sales prices in the free market. It was also found that the related sales concerned product types not imported from China. Undercutting and underselling were established on the basis of matching product types only, by comparing the Chinese import prices and the sales prices of the Union producers of matching product types. Thus the related sales did not affect the determination of undercutting and underselling. Finally, the development of injury indicators which were analysed separately for free and captive sales showed a comparable trend. On that basis, the argument made by the Chinese exporters has been taken into account but it does not affect the findings.</p>

               <num>(107)</num>
               <p>As explained in recital (83), the Union industry was loss-making in 2011, when the effects of the economic crisis were visible in the low consumption of rebars. The situation of the industry improved in 2012 and it became profitable. The industry then became again loss-making since 2013, in parallel with the start of the low-priced imports from China.</p>

               <p>Hence, the economic crisis cannot explain the difficulties of the industry that have reappeared since 2013.

               <num>(109)</num>
               <p>The Chinese exporters claimed that the injury suffered by the Union industry is a result of the use of scrap as a main raw material, whereas the Chinese producers are using iron ore.</p>

               <p>However, the price information supplied by the Chinese exporters shows that the prices of scrap broadly follow the trends of the prices of iron ore in the world markets. As shown in recital (81), the prices of both scrap and iron ore have decreased by roughly the same amount in terms of price per tonne. The fact that the decrease is different in percentage terms is not relevant for determining causality because the impact on production costs is determined by the development of the price per tonne in absolute terms. Furthermore, the difference of costs in absolute terms between iron ore and scrap reflects the fact that the transformation process into steel is different depending on the raw material used. The costs of two different raw materials are thus not directly comparable. Alleged differences in the development of the cost of raw material could therefore not break the causal link between the material injury found and the dumped imports. This claim must therefore be rejected.</p>

               <p>It has been demonstrated that there was a substantial increase in the volume and market share of the dumped imports originating in China in the period considered.

               <p>This increase in volume and market share of the dumped imports from China coincided with the deterioration of the financial situation of the Union industry as of 2013. Thus, despite the recovery in consumption, the Union industry was unable to increase its sales and prices, and consequently financial indicators such as profitability remained negative.</p>

As the dumped imports started in 2013, it is considered that the 2012 level of profits reflects what could be reasonably achieved under normal conditions of competition, i.e. in the absence of dumped imports.</p>

               <p>By contrast, the year 2011 was not considered to be a suitable reference year for normal conditions of competition: as explained in recital (107), the Union industry was still recovering from the impact of the economic crisis and was loss-making. The complainants have shown that the demand for steel in the UK was estimated at an exceptionally low level in 2011 (25 % lower than in 2007) Also the production costs were very high due to a peak in the price of scrap in 2011, as shown in recital (81). Finally, the complainants alleged that the rebars market in the UK was temporary disrupted by the sell-off of the stock of one UK producer, Thamesteel, before its liquidation in January 2012, which led to a temporary surge of supply volumes and discounted prices in 2011. For these reasons, the year 2011 could not be considered to be a period under normal market conditions and did not affect the setting of the target profit.</p>

               <p>As explained in recital (23) the Commission concluded that two of the cooperating groups of companies should be treated as related. A single injury margin was therefore established for the exporting producers of the two groups by expressing the sum of their individual underselling values as a percentage of the sum of their constructed CIF values on the Union frontier.</p>
