               <p>In line with the Rome Declaration of the Leaders of 27 Member States and of the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission of 25 March 2017, the Union budget should enable a safe and secure Europe. Nuclear decommissioning programmes have already contributed in this respect and can further contribute. After the shutdown of a nuclear facility, the main positive impact to be achieved is the progressive reduction of radiological risk for the workers, the public and the environment in the Member States concerned as well as in the Union as a whole.</p>

               <p>The Joint Research Centre (&apos;JRC&apos;) of the European Commission was established by Article 8 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (&apos;Euratom Treaty&apos;). In application of that Article, site agreements were signed during the period 1960-1962 between the Community, Germany, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands. In the cases of Italy and the Netherlands, national nuclear installations were transferred to the Community. An infrastructure geared to nuclear research and comprising new installations was put in place at the four sites. Some of those installations are still in use today, while others have been shut down, in some instances more than 20 years ago, and have mostly become obsolete.</p>

               <p>On the basis of Article 8 of the Euratom Treaty, and pursuant to Article 7 of Directive 2011/70/Euratom, the JRC, as a licence holder, is to manage its historical nuclear liabilities and decommission its nuclear installations that have been shut down in accordance with the relevant national legislation. Accordingly, the Nuclear Decommissioning and Waste Management Programme at the JRC was launched in 1999 with a communication to the European Parliament and the Council, and since then the Commission has provided regular updates on the progress of that programme.</p>

Those rules are laid down in the Financial Regulation and determine in particular the procedure for establishing and implementing the budget through grants, procurement, prizes and indirect implementation, and provide for checks on the responsibility of financial actors. Rules adopted on the basis of Article 322 of the TFEU also concern the general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union&apos;s budget.</p>

This should include consideration of the use of lump sums, flat rates and unit costs, as well as financing not linked to costs as referred to in point (a) of Article 125(1) of the Financial Regulation,</p>
