               <p>The objective of the Union&apos;s policy on asylum is to develop and establish a Common European Asylum System (CEAS) that is consistent with the values and humanitarian tradition of the Union and governed by the principle of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility.</p>

               <p>A common policy on asylum based on the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967, is a constituent part of the Union&apos;s objective of establishing progressively an area of freedom, security and justice open to third-country nationals or stateless persons who seek international protection in the Union.</p>

               <p>The CEAS is based on common minimum standards for procedures for international protection, recognition and protection offered at Union level and for reception conditions, and it establishes a system for determining the Member State responsible for examining applications for international protection. Notwithstanding the progress made on the CEAS, there are still significant disparities between the Member States as regards the granting of international protection and the form that such international protection takes. Those disparities should be addressed by ensuring greater convergence in the assessment of applications for international protection and by guaranteeing a uniform level of application of Union law, based on high protection standards, across the Union.</p>

               <p>In its communication of 6 April 2016 entitled &apos;Towards a reform of the Common European Asylum System and enhancing legal avenues to Europe&apos;, the Commission set out priority areas for structurally improving the CEAS, namely the establishment of a sustainable and fair system for determining the Member State responsible for asylum seekers, the reinforcement of the Eurodac system, the achievement of greater convergence in the Union asylum system, the prevention of secondary movements within the Union and the development of a new mandate for the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). That communication is in line with a call by the European Council on 18 February 2016 to make progress towards reforming the Union&apos;s existing framework so as to ensure a humane, fair and efficient asylum policy. That communication also proposes a way forward in line with the holistic approach to migration set out by the European Parliament in its own-initiative report of 12 April 2016 entitled &apos;The situation in the Mediterranean and the need for a holistic EU approach to migration&apos;.</p>

EASO enhances practical cooperation among Member States on asylum-related matters and assists Member States in implementing their obligations under the CEAS. EASO also provides support to Member States whose asylum and reception systems are under particular pressure. However, its role and function need to be further strengthened so as to not only support practical cooperation among Member States but to reinforce and contribute to ensuring the efficient functioning of the asylum and reception systems of the Member States.</p>

               <p>Having regard to the structural weaknesses of the CEAS, which were brought to the fore by the large-scale and uncontrolled arrival of migrants and asylum seekers to the Union, and the need for an efficient, high and uniform level of application of Union law on asylum in the Member States, it is necessary to improve the implementation and functioning of the CEAS by building on the work of EASO and further developing it into a fully-fledged agency. Such an agency should be a centre of expertise on asylum. It should facilitate and improve the functioning of the CEAS by coordinating and strengthening practical cooperation and information exchange on asylum among Member States, by promoting Union and international law on asylum and operational standards in order to ensure a high degree of uniformity based on high protection standards as regards procedures for international protection, reception conditions and the assessment of protection needs across the Union, by enabling genuine and practical solidarity among Member States in order to assist the affected Member States in general and applicants for international protection in particular and in accordance with Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which stipulates that relevant Union acts are to contain appropriate measures to give effect to the principle of solidarity, in order to apply in a sustainable way the Union rules for determining the Member State responsible for examining applications for international protection and in order to enable convergence in the assessment of applications for international protection across the Union, by monitoring the operational and technical application of the CEAS, by supporting Member States with resettlement and the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">

In that respect, Member States should include core parts of the European asylum curriculum in their training. It is important that those core parts cover issues related to the determination of whether applicants qualify for international protection, interview techniques and evidence assessment.

The common analysis should consist of an assessment of the situation in relevant countries of origin based on country-of-origin information. The guidance notes should be based on an interpretation of that common analysis developed by the Agency and Member States.

               <p>The Agency, in close cooperation with the Commission and without prejudice to the Commission&apos;s responsibility as guardian of the Treaties, should monitor the operational and technical application of the CEAS with the aim of preventing or identifying possible shortcomings in the asylum and reception systems of the Member States and of assessing their capacity and preparedness to manage situations of disproportionate pressure in order to enhance the efficiency of those systems (the &apos;monitoring mechanism&apos;). The monitoring mechanism should be comprehensive, and it should be possible to base the monitoring on information provided by the Member State concerned, the information analysis on the situation of asylum developed by the Agency, on-site visits, including short-notice visits, case sampling and information provided by intergovernmental organisations or bodies, in particular the UNHCR, and other relevant organisations on the basis of their expertise. The Executive Director should provide for the possibility for the Member State concerned to comment on the draft findings of a monitoring exercise carried out as part of the monitoring mechanism and, subsequently, on the draft recommendations. The Executive Director should draw up the draft recommendations in consultation with the Commission. After taking into account the comments of the Member State concerned, the Executive Director should submit to the Management Board the findings of the monitoring exercise and the draft recommendations, outlining the measures to be taken by the Member State concerned, including with the assistance of the Agency, as necessary, to address any shortcomings or issues of capacity and preparedness. The draft recommendations should specify the time limits within which those measures should be taken. The Management Board should adopt the recommendations.

It should be possible for the Commission to organise on-site visits to the Member State concerned in order to verify the implementation of the recommendations.

The power to adopt such an implementing act should be conferred on the Council due to the potentially politically sensitive nature of the measures to be decided and the possible impact which such measures might have on the tasks of the national authorities.

               <p>Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to facilitate the implementation and improve the functioning of the CEAS, to strengthen practical cooperation and information exchange among Member States on asylum-related matters, to promote Union law on asylum and operational standards to ensure a high degree of uniformity as regards procedures for international protection, reception conditions and the assessment of protection needs across the Union, to monitor the operational and technical application of the CEAS, and to provide increased operational and technical assistance to Member States for the management of their asylum and reception systems, in particular to Member States subject to disproportionate pressure on their asylum and reception systems, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.</p>

               <p>Taking into account the fact that Denmark has until now contributed to the practical cooperation between Member States within the area of asylum, the Agency should facilitate operational cooperation with Denmark.

Consequently, and having regard to the fact that Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland participate in the activities of EASO on the basis of arrangements concluded by those countries with the Union concerning their participation in EASO, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland should be able to participate in the activities of the Agency and contribute to the practical cooperation between Member States and the Agency in accordance with the terms and conditions established by existing or new arrangements. To that end, representatives of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland should be allowed to participate in the meetings of the Management Board as observers.</p>

               <p>This Regulation aims to amend and expand the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 439/2010. Since the amendments to be made are of substantial number and nature, that Regulation should, in the interests of clarity, be replaced in its entirety in relation to the Member States bound by this Regulation. The Agency, established by this Regulation, should replace and assume the functions of EASO, established by Regulation (EU) No 439/2010, which, as a consequence, should be repealed. With regard to the Member States bound by this Regulation references to the repealed Regulation should be construed as references to this Regulation.</p>

               <p>The provisions of this Regulation on the monitoring mechanism for the operational and technical application of the CEAS are linked, inter alia, with the system for determining the Member State responsible for examining applications for international protection established by Regulation (EU) No 604/2013. Since the system as established by that Regulation might change, it is deemed necessary to defer the application of those provisions to a later date, namely 31 December 2023. Moreover, the provisions on the monitoring mechanism which relate to the adoption of recommendations addressed to the Member State concerned and the provisions on situations of disproportionate pressure or the ineffectiveness of the asylum and reception systems are more directly linked to, and affected by, the responsibility aspects of the system established by Regulation (EU) No 604/2013. Since that Regulation might be replaced by a new legal act currently under negotiation, and given the importance of the relevant aspects of such a new legal act, those provisions should only apply from the date on which that Regulation is replaced, unless that Regulation is replaced before 31 December 2023, in which case those provisions should apply from 31 December 2023.</p>
