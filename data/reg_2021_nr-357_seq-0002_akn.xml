               <p>In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/6, a more prudent and responsible use of antimicrobials in animals is ensured, inter alia, by way of the prohibitions on the use of antimicrobials for growth promotion and yield increase and on the use of antimicrobials reserved for treatment of certain infections in humans. Under Article 118(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/6, operators in third countries are required to respect those prohibitions when exporting animals and products of animal origin to the Union. As highlighted in recital (49) of that Regulation, it is important to consider the international dimension of the development of antimicrobial resistance by taking non-discriminatory and proportionate measures, while respecting Union obligations under international agreements.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure the effective implementation of the prohibition of the use of antimicrobials for growth promotion and yield increase and of the use of antimicrobials reserved for treatment of certain infections in humans, official controls for the verification of compliance of animals and products of animal origin exported to the Union with Article 118(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/6 should be included in the scope of Regulation (EU) 2017/625, again while respecting Union obligations under international agreements.</p>

               <p>In accordance with Article 18(7), point (g), of Regulation (EU) 2017/625, the Commission is to adopt specific rules for the performance of official controls on criteria and conditions to determine, in relation to Pectinidae, marine gastropods and Holothuroidea, when production and relaying areas are not to be classified. Holothuroidea are a class of the phylum Echinodermata. Echinoderms are generally not filter-feeding animals. Consequently, the risk of such animals accumulating micro-organisms related to faecal contamination is remote. In addition, no epidemiological information has been reported which could link public health risks to echinoderms that are not filter feeders. For that reason, the possibility laid down in Article 18(7), point (g), of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 to derogate from the requirement to classify the production and relaying areas should be extended to all echinoderms which are not filter feeders, for example to those belonging to the class Echinoidea, and not be limited to Holothuroidea. For the same reason, it should be clarified that the conditions for the classification and monitoring of classified production and relaying areas to be laid down by the Commission apply to live bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods, except those marine gastropods and echinoderms that are not filter feeders. The terminology used in Article 18(6), (7) and (8) of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 should be aligned accordingly.</p>

               <p>Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">
                     <p>Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55).</p>
                  </authorialNote> excludes from its scope the direct supply, by the producer, of small quantities of meat from poultry and lagomorphs slaughtered on the farm to the final consumer or to local retail establishments directly supplying such meat to the final consumer as fresh meat. Since the date of application of that Regulation, namely 1 January 2006, the exclusion had been extended several times to all meat from poultry and lagomorphs as a transitional measure. The last extension of the transitional period, by Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/185<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="6">
                     <p>Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/185 of 2 February 2017 laying down transitional measures for the application of certain provisions of Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 29, 3.2.2017, p. 21).</p>
                  </authorialNote>, was until 31 December 2020. During the 15 years of the transitional period no significant food safety concerns caused by the activities carried out in accordance with that extension were observed. In addition, the Commission in its communication of 20 May 2020 entitled &apos;A Farm to Fork Strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food system&apos; underlines the importance of shorter supply chains with a view to enhancing resilience of regional and local food systems. The extension of the derogation to all meat of poultry and lagomorphs should therefore be introduced on a permanent basis. Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 should be amended accordingly.</p>
