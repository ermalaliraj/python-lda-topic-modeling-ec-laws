On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency, relating to the import volume of one or more categories of products that reach the volume indicated in Annex II-C to the Agreement in any given year starting on 1 January, and unless it has received a sound justification from Georgia, the Commission shall adopt an immediately applicable implementing act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 3(2) of this Regulation.

Before the expiry of that six-month period and on duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to the suspension of the preferential duties, the Commission may adopt an immediately applicable implementing act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 3(2) of this Regulation in order to lift the temporary suspension of the preferential duty if it is satisfied that the volume of the relevant category of products imported in excess of the volume referred to in Annex II-C to the Agreement results from a change in the level of production and export capacity of Georgia for the product or products concerned.</p>
