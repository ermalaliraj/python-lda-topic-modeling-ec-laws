               <p>In light of the establishment of the EPPO by means of enhanced cooperation, the division of competences between the EPPO and Eurojust with respect to crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union needs to be clearly established. From the date on which the EPPO assumes its tasks, Eurojust should be able to exercise its competence in cases which concern crimes for which the EPPO is competent, where those crimes involve both Member States which participate in enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the EPPO and Member States which do not participate in such enhanced cooperation. In such cases, Eurojust should act at the request of the non-participating Member States or at the request of the EPPO. Eurojust should in any case remain competent for offences affecting the financial interests of the Union whenever the EPPO is not competent or where, although the EPPO is competent, it does not exercise its competence. The Members States which do not participate in enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the EPPO may continue to request Eurojust&apos;s support in all cases regarding offences affecting the financial interests of the Union. The EPPO and Eurojust should develop close operational cooperation in line with their respective mandates.</p>

               <p>In order for Eurojust to fulfil its mission and develop its full potential in the fight against serious cross-border crime, its operational functions should be strengthened by reducing the administrative workload of national members, and its European dimension enhanced through the Commission&apos;s participation in the Executive Board and the increased involvement of the European Parliament and national parliaments in the evaluation of its activities.</p>

               <p>The forms of serious crime affecting two or more Member States for which Eurojust is competent should be clearly laid down. In addition, cases which do not involve two or more Member States, but which require a prosecution on common bases, should be defined. Such cases may include investigations and prosecutions affecting only one Member State and a third country where an agreement has been concluded with that third country or where there may be a specific need for Eurojust&apos;s involvement. Such prosecution may also refer to cases which affect one Member State and have repercussions at Union level.</p>

               <p>When exercising its operational functions in relation to concrete criminal cases, at the request of the competent authorities of Member States or on its own initiative, Eurojust should act either through one or more of the national members or as a College. By acting on its own initiative, Eurojust may take a more proactive role in coordinating cases, such as by supporting the national authorities in their investigations and prosecutions. This may include involving Member States that might not initially have been included in the case and discovering links between cases based on the information it receives from Europol, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), the EPPO and national authorities. This also allows Eurojust to produce guidelines, policy documents and casework-related analyses as part of its strategic work.</p>

               <p>At the request of a Member State&apos;s competent authority or of the Commission, it should also be possible for Eurojust to assist with investigations involving only that Member State but which have repercussions at Union level. Examples of such investigations include cases where a member of a Union institution or body is involved. Such investigations also cover cases which involve a significant number of Member States and could potentially require a coordinated European response.</p>

               <p>To ensure Eurojust can support and coordinate cross-border investigations appropriately, it is necessary that all national members have the necessary operational powers with respect to their Member State and in accordance with the law of that Member State in order to cooperate between themselves and with national authorities in a more coherent and effective way. National members should be granted those powers that allow Eurojust to appropriately achieve its mission. Those powers should include accessing relevant information in national public registers, directly contacting and exchanging information with competent authorities and participating in joint investigation teams. National members may, in accordance with their national law, retain the powers which are derived from their capacity as national authorities. In agreement with the competent national authority or in urgent cases, national members may also order investigative measures and controlled deliveries, and issue and execute requests for mutual legal assistance or mutual recognition. Since those powers are to be exercised in accordance with national law, the courts of Member States should be competent to review those measures, in accordance with the requirements and procedures laid down by national law.</p>

The College should exercise the power of appointing authority with respect to the Administrative Director. The College should also adopt Eurojust&apos;s rules of procedure.

               <p>Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the setting up of an entity responsible for supporting and strengthening coordination and cooperation between judicial authorities of the Member States in relation to serious crime affecting two or more Member States or requiring a prosecution on common bases, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.</p>
