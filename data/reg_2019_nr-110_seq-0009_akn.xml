Heinz Supply Chain Europe B.V., submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to &apos;Nutrimune<sup>®</sup>&apos; and immune defence against pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract and upper respiratory tract (Question No EFSA-Q-2016-00008<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">

               <p>On 30 January 2017, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority, which concluded that on the basis of the data presented, the scientific evidence is insufﬁcient to establish a cause and effect relationship between the consumption of &apos;Nutrimune®&apos; (a pasteurised cow&apos;s skim milk fermented with <i>Lactobacillus paracasei</i> CBA L74) and the immune defence against pathogens in the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tracts. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.</p>
