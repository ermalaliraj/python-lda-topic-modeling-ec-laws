               <p>The Treaty of Lisbon modified the legal framework governing the powers conferred on the Commission by the legislator, introducing a distinction between powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts), and the powers conferred on the Commission to adopt acts to ensure uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts (implementing acts).</p>

               <p>The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission subsequently agreed on a new framework for delegated acts in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="6">

In particular, they agreed on the need to give high priority to the prompt alignment of all basic acts which still refer to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. The Commission gave a commitment to prepare a proposal for that alignment by the end of 2016.</p>

               <p>Point 31 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making states that, on condition that the Commission provides objective justifications based on the substantive link between two or more empowerments contained in a single legislative act, and unless the legislative act provides otherwise, empowerments may be bundled. Consultations in the preparation of delegated acts also serve to indicate which empowerments are considered to be substantially linked. In such cases, any objection by the European Parliament or the Council will indicate clearly to which empowerment it specifically relates. In a limited number of basic acts listed in the Annex to this Regulation, a clear provision concerning adoption of separate delegated acts for different delegated powers has been included in the basic act.</p>
