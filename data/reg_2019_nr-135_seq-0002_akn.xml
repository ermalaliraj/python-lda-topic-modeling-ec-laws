               <p>Biometric data, such as fingerprints and facial images, are unique and therefore much more reliable than alphanumeric data for the purposes of identifying a person. The shared BMS should be a technical tool to reinforce and facilitate the work of the relevant EU information systems and the other interoperability components. The main purpose of the shared BMS should be to facilitate the identification of an individual who is registered in several databases, by using a single technological component to match that individual&apos;s biometric data across different systems, instead of several components. The shared BMS should contribute to security, as well as financial, maintenance and operational benefits. All automated fingerprint identification systems, including those currently used for Eurodac, VIS and SIS, use biometric templates comprised of data derived from a feature extraction of actual biometric samples. The shared BMS should regroup and store all these biometric templates &#45; logically separated according to the information system from which the data originated &#45; in one single location, thereby facilitating cross-system comparisons using biometric templates and enabling economies of scale in developing and maintaining the EU central systems.</p>

Biometric templates should be obtained from biometric data but it should not be possible to obtain that same biometric data from the biometric templates. As palm print data and DNA profiles are only stored in SIS and cannot be used to perform cross-checks with data present in other information systems, following the principles of necessity and proportionality, the shared BMS should not store DNA profiles or biometric templates obtained from palm print data.</p>

Member States dispose of efficient ways to identify their citizens or registered permanent residents in their territory. The interoperability between EU information systems should contribute to the correct identification of persons present in those systems. The CIR should store the personal data that are necessary to enable the more accurate identification of the individuals whose data are stored in those systems, including their identity data, travel document data and biometric data, regardless of the system in which the data were originally collected. Only the personal data strictly necessary to perform an accurate identity check should be stored in the CIR.

No adverse decision for the individual concerned should be made by the authorised end-user solely on the basis of the simple occurrence of a match-flag.

The linked data should be strictly limited to the data necessary to verify that a person is recorded in a justified or unjustified manner under different identities in different systems, or to clarify that two persons having similar identity data may not be the same person. Data processing through the ESP and the shared BMS in order to link individual files across different systems should be kept to an absolute minimum and therefore limited to multiple-identity detection, to be conducted at the time new data are added in one of the systems which has data stored in the CIR or added in SIS.

               <p>Both the Member States and eu-LISA should maintain security plans in order to facilitate the implementation of security obligations and should cooperate with each other in order to address security issues. eu-LISA should also make sure there is a continuous use of the latest technological developments to ensure data integrity in the context of the development, design and management of the interoperability components. eu-LISA&apos;s obligations in this respect should include adopting the measures necessary to prevent access by unauthorised persons, such as staff of external service providers, to personal data processed through the interoperability components. When awarding contracts for the provision of services, the Member States and eu-LISA should consider all measures necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations relating to the protection of personal data and to the privacy of individuals or to safeguard essential security interests, pursuant to Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="19">

               <p>The implementation of the interoperability components provided for in this Regulation will have an impact on the way checks are carried out at border crossing points. The impact will result from the combined application of the existing rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 and the rules on interoperability provided for in this Regulation.</p>

               <p>As a consequence of this combined application of the rules, the ESP should constitute the main access point for the compulsory systematic consultation of databases in respect of persons at border crossing points provided for by Regulation (EU) 2016/399. In addition, the identity data or travel document data that have led to the classification of a link in the MID as a red link should be taken into account by border guards for the purposes of assessing whether or not the person fulfils the conditions of entry defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/399. However, the presence of a red link should not in itself constitute a ground for refusal of entry and the existing grounds for refusal of entry listed in Regulation (EU) 2016/399 should therefore not be amended.</p>

Those logs shall be protected by appropriate measures against unauthorised access and erased one year after their creation. If, however, they are required for monitoring procedures that have already begun, they shall be erased once the monitoring procedures no longer require the logs.</p>
