Part E of the Union list sets out the following authorised additives for food category 12.3: Group I additives, caramels (E 150a-d) and sulphur dioxide &#45; sulphites (E 220-228) only in fermentation vinegar.</p>

               <p>It followed from the discussions with Member States at the Working Party of Governmental Experts on Additives that there is an equivalent technological need for food additives for diluted acetic acid and for vinegars from agricultural origin. Therefore, it is appropriate to revise the title of food category 12.3 &apos;Vinegars&apos; to specify that it includes diluted acetic acid (diluted with water to 4-30 % by volume) fit for human consumption in order to ensure that there is transparency and legal certainty regarding the use of food additives in that food.</p>

The statistics include the data on food consumption of vinegars from agricultural origin that is taken into account when the Authority performs the exposure assessment. As diluted acetic acid is used in the same manner as vinegars from agricultural origin it is not expected that the proposed amendment as regards the title of the food category 12.3 would have an impact on the exposure to additives authorised for use in that food category.</p>

               <p>Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission has to seek the opinion of the Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the inclusion of diluted acetic acid in food category 12.3 in Parts D and E of the Union list of food additives constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the Authority.</p>
