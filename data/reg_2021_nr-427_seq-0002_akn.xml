                     <p>Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 April 2021 establishing Horizon Europe &#45; the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for participation and dissemination, and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1290/2013 and (EU) No 1291/2013 (OJ L 170, 12.5.2021, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote> (the &apos;Horizon Europe Regulation&apos;) established the policy and legal framework for European partnerships with private or public sector partners. European partnerships are a key element of the policy approach of Horizon Europe &#45; the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (&apos;Horizon Europe&apos;). They are set up to deliver on Union priorities targeted by Horizon Europe and ensure a clear impact for the Union and its people, which can be achieved more effectively in partnership, through a strategic vision that is shared and committed to by partners, rather than by the Union alone.</p>

               <p>In particular, European partnerships in the &apos;Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness&apos; pillar of Horizon Europe play an important role in achieving strategic objectives such as accelerating the transitions towards sustainable development goals and a green and digital Europe, and should contribute to recovery from the unprecedented crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. European partnerships address complex cross-border challenges that require an integrated approach. They make it possible to address the transformational, systemic and market failures described in the impact assessments accompanying this Regulation by bringing together a broad range of players across the value chains and ecosystems to work towards a common vision and translating it into concrete roadmaps and coordinated implementation of activities. Furthermore, they enable efforts and resources to be concentrated on common priorities to solve the complex challenges.</p>

               <p>To deliver on priorities and impact, European partnerships should be developed through a broad involvement of relevant stakeholders across Europe including industry, research organisations, bodies with a public service mission at local, regional, national or international level, and civil society organisations such as foundations that support or carry out research and innovation. They should also be one of the measures to strengthen cooperation between private or public sector partners at the international level, including by joining up research and innovation programmes and cross-border investment in research and innovation, bringing mutual benefits to people and businesses while ensuring that the Union can uphold its interests in strategic areas.</p>

                  </authorialNote> revealed that a considerable repertoire of partnership instruments and initiatives have been introduced over time, with seven forms of implementation and close to 120 partnership initiatives running under Horizon 2020. In addition to the complexity generated by the proliferation of instruments and initiatives, it has been assessed that their ability to contribute to related policies at Union and national level as a whole is not sufficient despite the fact that they deliver positive impact in progressing towards their objectives, for example by setting long-term agendas, structuring research and innovation cooperation between otherwise dispersed actors, and leveraging additional investments. The impact assessment of Horizon Europe identifies therefore the need to address and to rationalise the Union research and innovation funding landscape, in particular with respect to partnerships, as well as to re-orient partnerships towards more impact and delivery on Union priorities.</p>

               <p>To address such concerns and to achieve the higher ambition for European investments, Horizon Europe should put forward a major simplification and reform for the Commission&apos;s policy on research and innovation partnerships. In order to reflect its systemic nature that aims to contribute to Union-wide &apos;transformations&apos; towards the sustainability objectives, Horizon Europe should make more effective use of those partnerships with a more strategic, coherent and impact-driven approach.</p>

               <p>Where relevant, European partnerships should consider technical screening criteria referred to in Article 3 and the &apos;do no significant harm&apos; principle set out in Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 as an instrument to improve their projects&apos; readiness and access to green financing that will be crucial for market uptake and wider deployment of the innovative technologies and solutions they will deliver. Scientific evidence is at the core of those technical screening criteria. Research and innovation, pursued by European partnerships, should play an important role in helping economic operators to reach or go beyond the standards and thresholds set in that Regulation, and to keep those technical screening criteria up-to-date and consistent with the objectives set out in the Commission Communication of 11 December 2019 on &apos;The European Green Deal&apos;.</p>

               <p>The new policy approach for European partnerships, and in particular institutionalised European partnerships, calls for a novel way of establishing the legal framework under which they would operate. While the setting-up of joint undertakings on the basis of Article 187 TFEU for the purpose of Horizon 2020 has proven to be effective as far as the implementation is concerned, it is necessary to step it up. Therefore, this Regulation aims to increase the coherence, efficiency, openness, effectiveness and impact-orientation of implementation by translating the Horizon Europe Regulation and the experience gained from programme implementation under Horizon 2020 into common provisions across the joint undertakings in a harmonised way. It aims to facilitate the creation of collaboration and synergies between European partnerships, thereby making full use of their interconnections at the organisational level. Joint undertakings should seek opportunities to involve representatives of other European partnerships in discussions during the drafting of their work programmes, identify the areas in which complementary or joint activities would address the challenges more effectively and efficiently, avoid overlaps, align timing of their activities and ensure access to results and other relevant means of knowledge exchange.</p>

               <p>Following the identification of synergies between them, joint undertakings should aim to determine budget shares which should be used for complementary or joint activities between joint undertakings. Moreover, this Regulation aims to improve efficiencies and harmonisation of the rules through intensified operational collaboration and by exploring economies of scale, including the establishment of back office arrangements which should provide horizontal support functions to the joint undertakings. Those back office arrangements should make it easier to achieve greater impact and harmonisation on common points while retaining a certain degree of flexibility to meet the specific needs of each joint undertaking. The structure should be established using service level agreements to be concluded by the joint undertakings. The back office arrangements should cover coordination and administrative support functions in areas where their screening has proved efficient and cost-effective and should take into account as far as possible compliance with the requirement of accountability of each individual authorising officer and harmonisation of the rules, including intellectual property rights. The legal set-up should be designed to best serve the common needs of the joint undertakings, to ensure their close collaboration and to explore all possible synergies among the European partnerships and, as a consequence, between the various parts of Horizon Europe as well as between the other programmes managed by the joint undertakings.</p>

               <p>Horizon Europe introduces a more strategic, coherent and impact-driven approach to European partnerships, building on the lessons learned from the Horizon 2020 interim evaluation. In line with the new ambition, this Regulation aims to achieve a more effective use of institutionalised European partnerships, in particular by focusing on clear objectives, outcomes and impact that can be achieved by 2030, and by ensuring a clear contribution to the related Union policy priorities and policies. Close collaboration and synergies with other relevant initiatives at Union, national and regional level, in particular with other European partnerships, are key to achieving greater scientific, socioeconomic and environmental impact and ensuring uptake of results. For this purpose, the joint undertakings may apply Horizon Europe provisions enabling different types of synergies, such as alternative, cumulative or combined funding and transfer of resources. In assessing the overall impact, broader investments beyond the contributions from partners and triggered by the joint undertakings that contribute to achieving their objectives should be taken into account to facilitate the acceleration of market uptake of innovative solutions.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure a coherent approach and capture the scientific, technological, economic, societal and environmental impacts of European partnerships in relation to the objectives of Horizon Europe and Union priorities, this Regulation should set out collective general and common specific objectives that should be delivered by all joint undertakings. All joint undertakings contribute collectively to achieving those objectives by reaching their individual objectives. In addition, the common parts of this Regulation define common operational objectives derived from the objectives set for the Specific Programme implementing Horizon Europe, established by Council Decision (EU) 2021/764<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="6">

               <p>This Regulation is based on the principles and criteria set out in the Horizon Europe Regulation, including openness and transparency, a strong leverage effect and long-term commitments of all the involved parties. One of the objectives of this Regulation is to ensure the openness of the joint undertakings and their actions to a broad range of entities, including newcomers who will be monitored also within the framework of the strategic coordinating process for European partnerships provided under Article 6(5) of the Specific Programme implementing Horizon Europe. Such partnerships should be open to any entity that is willing and able to work towards the common goal, should promote broad and active participation of stakeholders in their activities, membership and governance, and should ensure that the results would be for the benefit of all Europeans, in particular through a broad dissemination of results and pre-deployment activities across the Union. As regards private members and their constituent or affiliated entities established in third countries, the interests of the Union and the joint undertaking on the grounds of security or public order should be safeguarded. To that end, the Commission should be able to request private members to take appropriate measures. Such measures could include the appropriate handling of confidential information or limitation of certain entities in specific operational activities of the private member.</p>

In the case of joint undertakings with a Public Authorities Board, the application of that Article should be approved by the Public Authorities Board, following the request by the Commission, before the adoption of the work programme. Furthermore, following an invitation from the Chair, the Executive Director should inform regularly the relevant configuration of the Horizon Europe Programme Committee, further to the Commission&apos;s responsibility to inform the Programme Committee under Article 14(7) and Annex III of the Specific Programme implementing Horizon Europe, and in particular before the adoption of the work programme of the joint undertaking concerned, in relation to the application of Article 22(5) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.</p>

Conversely, the Union contribution, including any additional funds from associated countries, should not exceed 50 % of the aggregated budgetary commitments of each joint undertaking. Consequently, this Regulation should set the required contribution from members other than the Union at the same level or higher than the Union contribution.

Accordingly, each participating state should conclude one or more administrative agreements with the joint undertaking laying down the coordination mechanism for the payment of and reporting on contributions to applicants established in that participating state. In order to ensure coherence with their national strategic priorities, participating states should be provided with a right of veto over the use of their national financial contributions for applicants established in those participating states. In order to minimise the administrative burden for beneficiaries, achieve simplification and ensure a more efficient implementation, each participating state should strive to synchronise its payment schedule, reporting and audits with those of the joint undertakings and to converge its cost eligibility with the Horizon Europe Regulation. Beneficiaries established in participating states that entrusted the payment activities to the joint undertaking should sign a single grant agreement with the joint undertaking following Horizon Europe Regulation.</p>

               <p>In line with the ambitions set out in the Horizon Europe Regulation, one of the preconditions of setting up institutionalised European partnerships is ensuring partners&apos; contributions throughout the lifetime of the joint undertakings. In this context, private partners should deliver a significant part of their contributions in the form of in-kind contributions to operational costs of the joint undertaking. Joint undertakings should be able to identify measures to facilitate those contributions through their work programmes, in particular by reducing funding rates. Those measures should be based on the specific needs of a joint undertaking and the underlying activities. In duly justified cases, it should be possible to introduce additional conditions that require the participation of a member of the joint undertaking or their constituent or affiliated entities, targeting activities where the industrial partners of the joint undertaking can play a key role such as large-scale demonstrations and flagship projects closer to the market, and contribute more via lower funding rates. The level of participation of members should be monitored by the executive director in order to empower the governing board to take appropriate actions, ensuring a balance between commitment from partners and openness. In duly justified cases, the capital expenditure for, for example, large-scale demonstrations or flagship projects may be considered as an eligible cost in line with the applicable legal framework.</p>

               <p>In line with the principle of fair sharing of contributions among the members of joint undertakings, financial contributions to the administrative costs of the joint undertakings should be divided equally between the Union and the members other than the Union. Deviations from that principle should only be considered in exceptional and duly justified cases such as where the size or the membership structure of a member of the joint undertaking other than the Union would result in contributions per constituent or affiliated entity, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), of such a high level as to seriously jeopardise the incentive to become or remain a constituent or affiliated entity of the member of the joint undertaking. In such cases, the minimum percentage of annual financial contribution to the administrative costs of the joint undertaking from members other than the Union should be 20 % of the total annual administrative costs and the contributions from SMEs should be significantly lower than those from larger constituent or affiliated entities. Once a critical mass of membership that allows for a contribution higher than 20 % of the total annual administrative costs is reached, annual contributions per constituent or affiliated entity should be maintained or increased with the aim of gradually increasing the share of the members other than Union in the overall contribution to the annual administrative costs of the joint undertaking. The members of the joint undertaking other than the Union should endeavour to increase the number of constituent or affiliated entities in order to increase their contribution to 50 % of the administrative costs of the joint undertaking over its lifetime.</p>

Becoming a founding member or associated member, or one of their constituent or affiliated entities, enables members to gain influence, either directly or through the industry representatives, in the governing board of the joint undertaking. The governing board is the decision-making body of the joint undertaking that decides on the long-term strategic orientation of the partnership, as well as its annual priorities. The Union, the participating states where relevant, the founding members and associated members should therefore be able to contribute to the joint undertaking&apos;s agenda and priority-setting through the adoption and possible amendment of the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, as well as the adoption of the annual work programme, including the content of the calls for proposals, the applicable funding rate per call topic, and the related rules for submission, evaluation, selection, award and review procedures.</p>

               <p>Further simplification is a cornerstone of Horizon Europe. In that context, there should be a simplified reporting mechanism for partners, who are no longer required to report on non-eligible costs. In-kind contributions to operational activities should be accounted for solely on the basis of eligible costs and should be reported and audited in accordance with the mechanism applicable to the specific grant agreement. Such accounting on the basis of eligible costs only allows for the automated calculation of in-kind contributions to operational activities via the Horizon Europe IT tools, lowers the administrative burden for partners and makes the reporting mechanism for contributions more effective. In-kind contributions to operational activities should be closely monitored by the joint undertakings and regular reports should be prepared and made public by the executive director in order to establish whether the progress towards reaching the in-kind contributions targets is sufficiently satisfactory. The governing board should assess both the efforts made and the results achieved by the members contributing to operational activities, as well as other factors such as the level of participation of SMEs and attractiveness of the joint undertakings to newcomers. Where necessary it should take appropriate remedial and corrective measures, taking into account the principles of openness and transparency.</p>

The respective costs should be certified by an independent audit body appointed by the entity concerned subject to the valuation method being open to verification by the joint undertaking in the event of uncertainty. This Regulation should lay down more specific provisions concerning the scope of additional activities for each joint undertaking, to the extent that it is necessary to achieve the desired directionality and impact.

In line with the findings of the interim evaluation of the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking, a new initiative should ensure that every demonstrator is on the critical path for the development of the next aircraft programmes in order for the technologies developed to really serve the key priority of earliest possible deployment. Therefore, the new joint undertaking should focus on increasing the visibility of its individual exploitation objectives and strengthening the monitoring, management and reporting capabilities of the joint undertaking to reflect the complexity of the research and innovation effort required for the European partnership to reach its objectives.</p>

               <p>Rail is a complex system, with very close interactions between infrastructure managers, rail undertakings (train operators) and their respective equipment (infrastructure and rolling stock). It is impossible to deliver innovation without common specifications and strategy across the rail system. Therefore, the System Pillar of the Europe&apos;s Rail Joint Undertaking, which will gather input from relevant stakeholders from both outside and within the joint undertaking, should enable the sector to converge on a single operational concept and system architecture, including the definition of the services, functional blocks and interfaces, which form the basis of rail system operations. It should provide the overall framework to ensure that research targets customer requirements and operational needs that are commonly agreed and shared. The output of the System Pillar should support interoperability for the whole railway network, including TEN-T core and comprehensive network, and main lines and regional lines not included in the TEN-T. The governance model and the decision-making process of the Europe&apos;s Rail Joint Undertaking should reflect the Commission&apos;s leading role in unifying and integrating Europe&apos;s railway system, especially in rapidly and effectively delivering the single operational concept and system architecture, while involving the private partners in advisory and technical support roles.</p>

The Global Health EDCTP3 Joint Undertaking should address the lack of appropriate diagnostics, treatments and vaccines, among other so-called health technologies, to address infectious diseases, such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis but also other poverty-related and neglected infectious diseases, that are prevalent in Africa, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that, with the increased connectivity of different regions in the world, through world trade and tourism, infectious diseases can rapidly spread all over the world. Developing health technologies is therefore crucial to limit the spread of infectious diseases, as well as to fight them once they have spread, to protect the health of citizens in the countries concerned and in the Union. In order to achieve a stronger global health leadership than the preceding EDCTP2 initiative, the scope of the partnership should be extended to cover response to emerging infectious diseases threats, the increasing problems of antimicrobial resistance and non-communicable diseases co-morbidities.</p>

Such agreements should be concluded in the context of the annual budgetary procedure and programming of the joint undertaking. The Governing Board should adopt the annual work programme taking due account of those indicative commitments. The Public Authorities Board should select proposals. Only after those steps, and in line with the joint undertaking&apos;s financial rules, the authorising officer should make the budgetary and legal commitments for those indirect actions.</p>

               <p>With the purpose of creating a broad stakeholder base for ensuring the Smart Networks and Services partnership&apos;s objectives, the 6G Smart Networks and Services Industry Association (6G-IA)has been established building on the predecessor association. While the new industry association, in the first years following its establishment, is expected to have only a limited number of constituent and affiliated entities, it has the objective to include new members from stakeholder constituencies active in the Smart Network and Services value chain. Considering its expected modest size and the impact on its SMEs constituent entities, it is not sustainable for the association to contribute to 50 % of the administrative costs of the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking over its lifetime, in particular in the first years following its establishment. Additionally, the crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy has posed challenges for the European economic actors including in the field of information and communications technology. Therefore it should be ensured that the private partners of the joint undertaking are able to fulfil their commitments, while the conditions remain attractive and incentivise new partners to join the association. The minimum percentage of annual financial contribution to the administrative costs from members other than the Union should therefore be 20 % of the total annual administrative costs. In particular, it should be possible that SMEs constituent entities contribute less than bigger enterprises. The members of the joint undertaking other than the Union should endeavour to increase the number of constituent or affiliated entities in order to increase their contribution to 50 % of the administrative costs of the joint undertaking over its lifetime.</p>

               <p>Pursuant to the Council Conclusions of 3 December 2019 and the Recommendation of 26 March 2019 on Cybersecurity of 5G networks for coordinated action at Union level, the Member States&apos; Cooperation Group on Network and Information Security published the EU toolbox of risk mitigating measures concerning cyber-security of 5G networks of January 2020 (the &apos;toolbox&apos;). The toolbox includes a set of strategic and technical measures as well as supporting actions in order to mitigate the main cybersecurity risks of 5G networks, which have been identified in the Union coordinated risk assessment report, and to provide guidance for the selection of measures that should be prioritised in mitigation plans at national and at Union level. The Commission Communication of 29 January 2020 on Implementing the EU toolbox endorses all measures and guidance set out in the toolbox and emphasises the need for restrictions, including necessary exclusions, concerning suppliers considered to be high risk based on the factors specified in the Union coordinated risk assessment as well as measures to avoid dependency on those suppliers. It also identifies a set of specific actions for the Commission, in particular to ensure that participation in Union funding programmes in relevant technology domains will be conditional on compliance with security requirements, by making full use of and further implementing security conditions. Therefore, the implementation of this Regulation should introduce appropriate provisions to reflect the security measures through actions funded by the SNS Joint Undertaking and, on the basis of its recommendations, by other funding bodies implementing other Union programmes in the area of smart networks and services.</p>

People-centred care refers to an approach to care that consciously adopts individuals&apos;, carers&apos;, families&apos; and communities&apos; perspectives and considers them as participants as well as beneficiaries of health care systems that are organised around their needs and preferences rather than individual diseases.</p>

                     <p>The Commission shall carry out an interim and a final evaluation of each Joint Undertaking feeding into the Horizon Europe evaluations, as specified in Article 52 of the Horizon Europe Regulation. The evaluations shall examine how each joint undertaking fulfils its mission and objectives, cover all activities of the joint undertaking and evaluate the joint undertaking&apos;s concerned European added value, effectiveness, efficiency, including its openness and transparency, the relevance of the activities pursued and their coherence and complementarity with relevant regional, national and Union policies, including synergies with other parts of Horizon Europe, such as missions, clusters or thematic or specific programmes. The evaluations shall take into account the views of stakeholders, at both European and national level and shall, where relevant, also include an assessment of the long-term scientific, societal, economic and technological impacts of the joint undertakings referred to in Article 174(3) to (9). The evaluations shall also include, where relevant, an assessment of the most effective policy intervention mode for any future action, as well as the relevance and coherence of any possible renewal of each joint undertaking given the overall policy priorities and the research and innovation support landscape, including its positioning against other initiatives supported through the Framework Programme, in particular European partnerships or missions. The evaluations shall also take due account of the phasing-out plan adopted by the Governing Board in accordance with Article 17(2), point (a1).</p>
