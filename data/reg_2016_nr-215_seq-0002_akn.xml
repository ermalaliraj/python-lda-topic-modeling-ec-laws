               <p>In the context of a procedure for the authorisation of the use of a plant protection product containing the active substance thiacloprid on rapeseed, an application was submitted in accordance with Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 for modification of the existing MRL in honey and other apiculture products.</p>

               <p>The European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter &apos;the Authority&apos;, assessed the application and the evaluation report, examining in particular the risks to the consumer and, where relevant, to animals and gave a reasoned opinion on the proposed MRL<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">

            <recital xml:id="rec_d66e108">
               <num>(5)</num>
               <p>The Authority concluded that all requirements with respect to data were met and that the modification to the MRL requested by the applicant was acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups. It took into account the most recent information on the toxicological properties of the substance. Neither the lifetime exposure to this substance via consumption of all food products that may contain it nor the short-term exposure due to high consumption of the relevant product showed that there is a risk that the acceptable daily intake or the acute reference dose is exceeded.</p>

               <num>(6)</num>
               <p>The Authority proposed several MRLs for honey, to be considered by the risk managers, which were based on, respectively, the field trials submitted by the applicant and Union wide monitoring data. As there is no risk to consumers, the MRL for thiacloprid in honey should be set at the level of 0,2 mg/kg on the basis of the available residue trials. The monitoring data are in a similar range and confirm such level.</p>

               <num>(7)</num>
               <p>Based on the reasoned opinion of the Authority and taking into account the factors relevant to the matter under consideration, the appropriate modification to the MRL fulfils the requirements of Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.</p>
