               <p>For abamectin and maleic hydrazide, maximum residue levels (MRLs) were set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. For fluopyram, fluxapyroxad and tefluthrin, MRLs were set in Part A of Annex III to that Regulation. For beer and mustard seeds powder, no specific MRLs were set nor were those substances included in Annex IV to that Regulation, so the default value of 0,01 mg/kg laid down in Article 18(1)(b) thereof applies.</p>

               <p>In accordance with Article 6(2) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 an application was submitted for fluxapyroxad used on citrus fruits. The applicant claims that the authorised uses of that substance on such crops in Brazil lead to residues exceeding the MRLs contained in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 and that higher MRLs are necessary to avoid trade barriers for the importation of those crops.</p>

               <p>The Authority concluded in its reasoned opinions that, as regards the use of fluxapyroxad on citrus fruits, the submitted data were not sufficient to set a new MRL for the entire group. However, in accordance with the existing Union guidelines on extrapolation of MRLs, it is appropriate to set the MRL for grapefruits at the value of the existing MRL for oranges. The existing MRLs for citrus fruits should therefore be kept at the current values except for grapefruits for which the MRL should be increased to 0,3 mg/kg.</p>

               <p>As regards all other applications, the Authority concluded that all requirements with respect to data were met and that the modifications to the MRLs requested by the applicants were acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups. The Authority took into account the most recent information on the toxicological properties of the substances. Neither the lifetime exposure to these substances via consumption of all food products that may contain them, nor the short-term exposure due to high consumption of the relevant products showed that there is a risk that the acceptable daily intake or the acute reference dose is exceeded.</p>
