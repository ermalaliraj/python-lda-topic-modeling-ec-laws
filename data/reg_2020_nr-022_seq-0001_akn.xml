               <p>Financial markets are pivotal for the functioning of modern economies. The more integrated they are, the greater the potential for efficient allocation of economic resources will be, potentially benefitting economic performance. However, in order to improve the functioning of the single market in financial services, it is important to have procedures in place to deal with effects of market turmoil and to ensure that if a financial institution or a financial market infrastructure that is active in this market faces financial distress or is at the point of failure, such an event does not de-stabilise the entire financial market and damage growth across the wider economy.</p>

               <p>Central counterparties (CCPs) are key components of global financial markets, stepping in between participants to act as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer, and playing a central role in processing financial transactions and managing exposures to diverse risks inherent in those transactions. CCPs centralise the handling of transactions and positions of counterparties, honour the obligations created by the transactions, and require adequate collateral from their members as margin and as contributions to default funds.</p>

               <p>The integration of Union financial markets has resulted in CCPs evolving from primarily serving domestic needs and markets to constituting critical nodes in Union financial markets more widely. CCPs authorised in the Union today clear several product classes, including listed and over-the-counter (OTC) financial and commodity derivatives, cash equities, bonds and other products such as repos. They provide services across national borders to a broad range of financial and other institutions across the Union. While some CCPs remain focused on domestic markets, they are all systemically important at least in their home markets.</p>

               <p>As a significant amount of the financial risk of the Union financial system is processed by and concentrated in CCPs on behalf of clearing members and their clients, effective regulation and robust supervision of CCPs are essential. Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">
                     <p>Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote> requires CCPs authorised in the Union to observe high prudential, organisational and conduct of business standards. Competent authorities, working together within supervisory colleges which group together relevant authorities for the specific tasks allocated to them, are tasked with the full oversight of the activities of CCPs. In accordance with commitments entered into by G20 leaders since the 2008 financial crisis, Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 also requires standardised OTC derivatives to be centrally cleared by a CCP. As the obligation to centrally clear OTC derivatives comes into effect, the volume and range of business done by CCPs is likely to increase which could, in turn, provide additional challenges for risk management strategies of CCPs.</p>

               <p>Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 has contributed to the increased resilience of CCPs and of wider financial markets against the broad range of risks processed and concentrated in CCPs. However, no system of rules and practices can prevent existing resources from being inadequate in managing the risks incurred by a CCP, including one or more defaults by clearing members. Faced with a scenario of severe financial distress or impending failure, financial institutions should in principle remain subject to normal insolvency proceedings. However, as the 2008 financial crisis has shown, in particular during a period of prolonged economic instability and uncertainty, such proceedings can disrupt functions critical to the economy, jeopardising financial stability. Normal corporate insolvency procedures may not always ensure sufficient speed of intervention or adequately prioritise the continuity of the critical functions of financial institutions for the sake of preserving financial stability. In order to prevent such negative consequences of normal insolvency proceedings, it is necessary to create a special resolution framework for CCPs.</p>

               <p>The 2008 financial crisis highlighted the lack of adequate tools to preserve the critical functions provided by failing financial institutions. It further demonstrated the absence of frameworks to enable cooperation and coordination amongst authorities, in particular those located in different Member States or jurisdictions, to ensure the taking of swift and decisive action. Without such tools and in the absence of cooperation and coordination frameworks, Member States were compelled to rescue financial institutions using taxpayer money in order to stem contagion and reduce panic. While CCPs were not direct recipients of extraordinary public financial support in the 2008 financial crisis, they were protected from the effects that banks failing to perform their obligations would otherwise have had on them. A recovery and resolution framework for CCPs complements the bank resolution framework adopted under Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">
                     <p>Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms and amending Council Directive 82/891/EEC, and Directives 2001/24/EC, 2002/47/EC, 2004/25/EC, 2005/56/EC, 2007/36/EC, 2011/35/EU, 2012/30/EU and 2013/36/EU, and Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 and (EU) No 648/2012, of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 190).</p>

Such a framework should also address the possibility of CCPs entering into resolution for reasons other than the default of one or several of their clearing members.</p>

               <p>The objective of a credible recovery and resolution framework is to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that CCPs set out measures to recover from financial distress, to maintain the critical functions of a CCP which is failing or likely to fail while winding up the remaining activities through normal insolvency proceedings, and to preserve financial stability and to avoid a significant adverse effect on the financial system and its ability to serve the real economy while minimising the cost to taxpayers of a CCP failure. A recovery and resolution framework further bolsters the preparedness of CCPs and authorities to mitigate financial distress and provide authorities with further insight into CCPs&apos; preparations for stress scenarios. It also provides authorities with powers to prepare for the potential resolution of a CCP and deal with the declining health of a CCP in a coordinated manner, thus contributing to the smooth functioning of financial markets.</p>

               <p>Currently, there are no harmonised provisions for the recovery and resolution of CCPs across the Union. Some Member States have already enacted legislative changes that require CCPs to draw up recovery plans and that introduce mechanisms to resolve failing CCPs. Furthermore, there are considerable substantive and procedural differences between Member States on the laws, regulations and administrative provisions which govern the insolvency of CCPs. The absence of common conditions, powers and processes for the recovery and resolution of CCPs is likely to constitute a barrier to the smooth functioning of the internal market and hinder cooperation between national authorities when dealing with the failure of a CCP and applying appropriate loss allocation mechanisms on its clearing members, both in the Union and globally. This is particularly true where different approaches mean that national authorities do not have the same level of control or the same ability to resolve CCPs. Those differences in recovery and resolution regimes might affect CCPs, clearing members and the clients of clearing members differently across Member States, potentially creating competitive distortions across the internal market. The absence of common rules and tools for how financial distress or failure in a CCP should be handled can affect clearing members&apos; and their clients&apos; choice to clear and CCPs&apos; choice of their place of establishment, thereby preventing CCPs from fully benefiting from their fundamental freedoms within the internal market. In turn, this could discourage clearing members and their clients from accessing CCPs across borders in the internal market and hinder further integration in the Union&apos;s capital markets. Common recovery and resolution rules in all Member States are therefore necessary to ensure that CCPs are not limited in exercising their internal market freedoms by the financial capacity of Member States and their authorities to manage their failure.</p>

               <p>The review of the regulatory framework applicable to banks and to other financial institutions which has taken place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and in particular the strengthening of banks&apos; capital and liquidity buffers, better tools for macro-prudential policies and comprehensive rules on the recovery and resolution of banks, have reduced the likelihood of future crises and enhanced the resilience of all financial institutions and market infrastructures, including CCPs, to economic stress, whether caused by systemic disturbances or by events specific to individual institutions. Since 1 January 2015, a recovery and resolution regime for banks has applied in Member States pursuant to Directive 2014/59/EU.</p>

               <p>Building on the approach for bank recovery and resolution, competent authorities and resolution authorities should be prepared and have adequate tools at their disposal to handle situations involving CCP failures. However, due to their different functions and business models, the risks inherent in banks and CCPs are different. Specific tools and powers are therefore needed for CCP failure scenarios caused by the failure of the CCP&apos;s clearing members or as a result of non-default events.</p>

               <p>A regulation is the proper legal act to choose in order to complement and build on the approach established by Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, which provides for uniform prudential requirements applicable to CCPs. Setting recovery and resolution requirements in a directive could create inconsistencies by the adoption of potentially different national rules in respect of an area otherwise governed by directly applicable Union law and increasingly characterised by the cross-border provision of CCPs&apos; services. Therefore uniform and directly applicable rules on recovery and resolution of CCPs should also be adopted.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure consistency with existing Union legislation in the area of financial services, as well as the greatest possible level of financial stability across the Union, the recovery and resolution regime laid down in this Regulation should apply to CCPs that are subject to the prudential requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, regardless of whether they have a banking licence. While there might be differences in the risk profile associated with alternative corporate structures, CCPs are stand-alone entities that are required to fulfil all requirements under this Regulation and under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 independently from their parent undertaking or other group entities. The group of which a CCP forms part does not therefore need to be subject to this Regulation. The group dimension, including, inter alia, the operational, personal and financial relations of a CCP with group entities, should, however, be taken into account in the CCP&apos;s recovery and resolution planning insofar it could affect the recovery or resolution of the CCP or insofar recovery and resolution actions could have an impact on other entities of the group.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure that resolution actions are taken efficiently and effectively, and in line with resolution objectives, Member States should appoint, as resolution authorities for the purpose of this Regulation, national central banks, competent ministries, public administrative authorities or authorities entrusted with public administrative powers to perform functions and tasks in relation to resolution, including any existing resolution authorities. Member States should also ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to those resolution authorities. In Member States where a CCP is established, adequate structural arrangements should be put in place to separate the CCP resolution functions from other functions, in particular where the authority responsible for the prudential supervision of the CCP, or prudential supervision of credit institutions or investment firms that are clearing members of the CCP, is designated as the resolution authority, to avoid any conflicts of interest and risk of regulatory forbearance. In such cases, the independence of the resolution authority&apos;s decision-making process should be ensured, while not preventing decision-making from converging at the highest level.</p>

               <p>In light of the consequences that the failure of a CCP and the subsequent actions might have on the financial system and the economy of a Member State, as well as the possible ultimate need to use public funds to resolve a crisis, the Ministries of Finance or other relevant ministries in Member States should be able to decide, in line with national democratic procedures, on the use of public funds as a last resort and should consequently be closely involved, at an early stage, in the process of recovery and resolution. Therefore, with regard to the use of public funds as a last resort, this Regulation should be without prejudice to the distribution of competences between the relevant ministries or the government and the resolution authority as provided for in the legal systems of Member States.</p>

               <p>As CCPs often provide services across the Union, effective recovery and resolution requires cooperation among competent authorities and resolution authorities within supervisory and resolution colleges, notably at the preparatory stages of recovery and resolution. That includes assessing the recovery plan developed by the CCP, contributing to and reaching a joint decision on resolution plans drawn up by the resolution authority of the CCP, and addressing any impediments to resolvability of the CCP.</p>

               <p>The resolution of CCPs should strike the balance between the need, on the one hand, for procedures that take into account the urgency of the situation and allow for efficient, fair and timely solutions and, on the other, the necessity to protect financial stability in the Member States where the CCP provides services. The authorities whose areas of competence would be affected by the failure of a CCP should share their views in the resolution college to achieve those objectives. This should include in particular sharing information on the preparation of clearing members and, where relevant, clients with regard to potential default management, recovery and resolution measures and the supervisory treatment of the related exposures towards the CCP. The authorities of Member States whose financial stability could be impacted by the failure of the CCP should be able to participate in the resolution college based on their assessment of the impact that the CCP&apos;s resolution could have on financial stability in their respective Member State. Member States should have the possibility to be represented in the resolution college by the competent authorities and resolution authorities of clearing members. Member States which are not represented by clearing members&apos; authorities should be able to participate by choosing between participation in the college of the competent authority of clearing members&apos; clients and of the resolution authority of clearing members&apos; clients. The authorities should provide appropriate justification for their participation, based on their analysis of the negative impact that the CCP&apos;s resolution could have on their Member States, to the resolution authority of the CCP. Similarly, in order to ensure a regular exchange of views and coordination with relevant third-country authorities, these should be invited to participate in resolution colleges as observers where necessary.</p>

               <p>In order to address the potential failure of a CCP in an effective and proportionate manner, authorities should take into account a number of factors when exercising their recovery and resolution powers such as the nature of the CCP&apos;s business, ownership structure, legal and organisational structure, risk profile, size, legal status, substitutability and interconnectedness to the financial system. The authorities should also take account of whether its failure and subsequent winding up under normal insolvency proceedings would be likely to have a significant negative effect on financial markets, on other financial institutions, or on the wider economy.</p>

               <p>In order to deal in an efficient manner with failing CCPs, competent authorities should have the power to impose preparatory measures on CCPs. A minimum standard should be established as regards the contents and information to be included in recovery plans to ensure that all CCPs in the Union have sufficiently detailed recovery plans should they face financial distress. Such recovery plan should contemplate an appropriate range of scenarios, envisaging both systemic and specific stresses to the CCP, that would endanger its viability, also taking into account the potential impact of contagion in a crisis, both domestic and cross-border. The scenarios should be more severe than those used for the purposes of regular stress testing pursuant to Article 49 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, while remaining plausible. The recovery plan should cover a broad range of scenarios including scenarios resulting from default events, non-default events and a combination of both; and should include comprehensive arrangements for the re-establishment of a matched book, for the full allocation of losses arising from clearing member default, and adequate absorbency for all other types of losses. Recovery plans should distinguish between different types of non-default events. The recovery plan should form part of the operating rules of the CCP agreed contractually with clearing members. Those operating rules should further contain provisions to ensure the enforceability of recovery measures outlined in the recovery plan in all scenarios. Recovery plans should not assume access to extraordinary public financial support or expose taxpayers to the risk of loss.</p>

               <p>In order to create sound incentives <i>ex-ante</i> and to ensure a fair allocation of losses, recovery plans should ensure that the application of recovery tools appropriately balances the allocation of losses between CCPs, clearing members and, where applicable, their clients. As a general principle, losses in recovery should be distributed between CCPs, clearing members, and, where applicable, their clients as a function of their responsibility for the risk transferred to the CCP and their ability to control and manage such risks. Recovery plans should ensure that the CCP&apos;s capital is exposed to losses caused by both default and non-default events, before losses are allocated to clearing members. As an incentive for proper risk management and to further reduce the risks of losses for the taxpayer, the CCP should use a portion of its pre-funded dedicated own resources as referred to in Article 43 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, which can include any capital it holds in addition to its minimum capital requirements, to comply with the notification threshold referred to in the delegated act adopted on the basis of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, as a recovery measure before resorting to other recovery measures requiring financial contributions from clearing members. That additional amount of pre-funded dedicated own resources, which is distinct from the pre-funded own resources referred to in Article 45(4) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, should not be lower than 10 % nor higher than 25 % of the risk based capital requirements calculated in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 irrespective of whether those requirements are lower or higher than the initial capital referred to in Article 16(1) of that Regulation.</p>

The effects of the recovery measures on clearing members and, where the relevant information is available, their clients and on the financial system of the Union or of one or more of its Member States more broadly should be proportionate. In particular, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 CCPs have to ensure that their clearing members have limited exposures toward the CCP. CCPs should ensure that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the drawing-up of the recovery plan through their involvement in the CCP&apos;s risk committee, as the case might be, and by being appropriately consulted.

The plans should be drawn up by the resolution authority of the CCP and jointly agreed in the resolution college. The plans should cover a broad range of scenarios, distinguishing scenarios resulting from default events, non-default events and a combination of both, as well as different types of non-default events. Authorities should have all the information necessary to identify and ensure the continuity of critical functions. The content of a resolution plan should, however, be appropriate to the activities of the CCP and the types of products it clears and it should be based, inter alia, on the information provided by it. In order to facilitate the enforcement of resolution cash calls and of the reduction of the amount of any gains payable to a non-defaulting clearing member of a CCP under resolution, a reference to the power of the resolution authority to require such resolution cash calls and such reduction should be included in the operating rules of the CCP.

Competent authorities should therefore be granted early intervention powers to avoid or minimise adverse effects on financial stability or on the interests of clients that could result from the CCP&apos;s implementation of certain measures. Early intervention powers should be conferred on competent authorities in addition to their powers provided for in the national law of Member States or under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for circumstances other than those considered to be early intervention.

If the reasons continue to exist, the resolution authority should refrain from enforcing those obligations.

In the case of non-default losses, losses should be absorbed by regulatory capital instruments and should be allocated to shareholders up to their capacity either through the cancellation or transfer of instruments of ownership or through severe dilution. Where those instruments are not sufficient, resolution authorities should have the power to write-down unsecured debt and liabilities, in accordance with their ranking under applicable national insolvency law, and apply loss allocation tools, to the extent necessary without jeopardising broader financial stability.</p>

               <p>If, after losses have been absorbed and, where applicable, the CCP has been restored to a matched book and the pre-funded resources of the CCP remain depleted, the resolution authority should ensure that those resources are restored to the levels necessary to meet regulatory requirements, either through the continued exercise of the tools in the CCP&apos;s operating rules or through other actions. In particular, resolution authorities should have the possibility to compensate non-defaulting clearing members that would have been entitled to a &apos;no creditor worse off&apos; compensation payment for the application of loss allocation tools that would result in losses in excess of those that the clearing members would have borne under their obligations under the CCP&apos;s operating rules with instruments of ownership, debt instruments or instruments recognising a claim on the CCP&apos;s future profits. When assessing the amount and the form of compensation, the resolution authority can consider, for example, the financial soundness of the CCP, and the quality of instruments available for compensation and for meeting the &apos;no creditor worse off&apos; safeguard. To maintain an adequate incentive structure, such compensation should reflect the extent to which a clearing member has supported the recovery of the CCP and therefore also take into account the remaining outstanding contractual obligations of the clearing members towards that CCP. Such compensation should be deducted from any entitlement to a &apos;no creditor worse off&apos; payment.</p>

If the resolution authority uses such measure it should not discriminate anybody on the basis of nationality.</p>

The outstanding recovery tools and resolution tools, in particular the write-down tool, should be applied to the fullest extent possible before or together with any public sector injection of capital or equivalent extraordinary public financial support is given to a CCP.

               <p>An effective resolution regime should minimise the costs of the resolution of a failing CCP borne by the taxpayers. It should ensure that CCPs can be resolved without jeopardising financial stability. The write-down tool and the loss and position allocation tools should achieve that objective by ensuring that shareholders and counterparties who are among the creditors of the failing CCP suffer appropriate losses and bear an appropriate part of the costs arising from the failure of the CCP. The write-down and the loss and position allocation tools therefore give shareholders and counterparties of CCPs a stronger incentive to monitor the health of a CCP during normal circumstances in accordance with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) provided for in its document &apos;Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions&apos;.</p>

               <p>The Commission should be able to suspend any clearing obligation established pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, following a request from the resolution authority of a CCP under resolution or its competent authority, on their own initiative or at the request of the competent authority responsible for the supervision of a clearing member of the CCP under resolution, and following a non-binding opinion by ESMA, for a specific type of counterparty or for specific classes of OTC derivatives which are cleared by a CCP under resolution. The decision to suspend the clearing obligation should be adopted only if it is necessary to preserve financial stability and market confidence, in particular to avoid contagion effects and to prevent counterparties and investors having high and uncertain risk exposures to a CCP. In order to adopt its decision, the Commission should take into account the resolution objectives, the criteria stated in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for subjecting OTC derivatives to the clearing obligation regarding those OTC derivatives for which the suspension is requested and whether it is necessary to suspend the clearing obligation in order to preserve financial stability and the orderly functioning of financial markets in the Union. ESMA should be able to request the Commission to suspend the trading obligation laid down in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="11">

The suspension should be of a temporary nature with a possibility of extension. Likewise, the role of the CCP&apos;s risk committee, as set out in Article 28 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, should be enhanced to further encourage the CCP to manage its risks prudently and improve its resilience. Members of the risk committee should be able to inform the competent authority when the CCP does not follow the risk committee&apos;s advice, and representatives of clearing members and clients on the risk committee should be able to use information provided to monitor their exposures to the CCP, in accordance with confidentiality safeguards and without prejudice to the limitations to the exchange of such information laid out in competition law. Finally, resolution authorities of CCPs should also have access to all necessary information in trade repositories.

               <p>In order to ensure the proper implementation of the interest rate benchmark reform of the FSB it is necessary to provide clarity to market participants that transactions entered into or novated before the entry into application of the clearing or margin requirements to OTC derivative transactions referencing an interest rate benchmark (legacy trades) will not be subject to the requirements as provided for in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 when they are novated for the sole purpose of implementing or preparing for the implementation of the interest rate benchmark reform. Doing so should also prevent any risk that Union counterparties to those legacy trades find themselves unprepared when a specific benchmark is materially changed or discontinued, therefore alleviating related financial stability concerns. Such approach is in line with the international guidance from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).</p>

               <p>Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 provides for a transitional period during which Article 35 or 36 of that Regulation would not apply to those CCPs or trading venues which applied to their competent authority to benefit from the transitional arrangements, in respect of exchange-traded derivatives. The transitional period during which a trading venue or a CCP can be exempted by its national competent authority, in respect of exchange-traded derivatives from the application of Articles 35 and 36 of that Regulation expired on 3 July 2020. The current market environment, with a high degree of uncertainty and volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively impacts CCPs and trading venues&apos; operations by increasing their operational risks. Those increased risks, combined with limited capacity for assessing access requests and for managing the migration of transactions flows, might impact the orderly functioning of markets or financial stability. In addition, that Regulation provides for a novel exchange-traded derivatives regime on access to critical market infrastructures which aims to balance more competition amongst those infrastructures with the need to preserve their operational integrity. Therefore, while that Regulation seeks to create a competitive market for financial infrastructures, economic operators should not expect that existing rules and priorities are maintained when economic circumstances change as a consequence, in particular, of a major economic crisis. This is particularly the case in an area where the interaction between critical market infrastructures, such as trading and clearing infrastructures, requires an exceptional level of operational resilience, as any failures in such critical infrastructures would pose a high risk to financial stability. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the application date of the new open access regime for trading venues and CCPs offering trading and clearing services in relation to exchange-traded derivatives is postponed by one year, until 3 July 2021.</p>

               <p>The application of this Regulation should be deferred until 12 August 2022 to establish all essential implementing measures and to allow CCPs and other market participants to take the necessary steps for compliance purposes. However, the requirement for the CCP to use dedicated own resources in recovery and the provisions to recompense clearing members in the extraordinary case of applying variation margin gains haircutting in recovery, rely on the appropriate regulatory technical standards to be in place. It is therefore appropriate to extend the deferral of the date of application for such provision until 12 February 2023. Additionally, certain provisions that apply to CCP recovery plans and the adoption and review of recovery plans, including the obligation to submit a recovery plan, should be applied from an earlier date, since all CCPs already have recovery plans, as required by the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures published by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the IOSCO. CCPs already authorised under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should take the appropriate steps to ensure that they will be able to submit their recovery plans to their competent authorities at the latest on 12 February 2022. Those provisions related to recovery plans should be applied from 12 February 2022. If the resolution authority had not been consulted on the recovery plan of the CCP, once the other provisions of this Regulation become applicable, the competent authority of the CCP should consult the resolution authority on the CCP&apos;s recovery plan without delay. In order to ensure legal certainty for counterparties, the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 intended to ensure the proper implementation of the FSB&apos;s interest rate benchmark reform should apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.</p>

               <p>This Regulation should ensure that CCPs have sufficient loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity to ensure smooth and fast absorption of losses and recapitalisation with a minimum impact on financial stability while aiming to avoid an impact on taxpayers. Consistently with the internationally agreed principles for effective resolution regimes for financial institutions developed by the FSB, this Regulation should ensure that equity holders of a CCP absorb losses first in resolution in a way that minimises the risk of legal challenge by equity holders, on the basis that their losses in resolution are greater than the losses that they would have incurred under normal insolvency proceedings according to the &apos;no creditor worse off&apos; principle. On 15 November 2018, the FSB published a consultation paper entitled &apos;Financial resources to support CCP resolution and the treatment of CCP equity in resolution&apos;. Based on the feedback received to that paper and further assessments, the FSB plans to issue guidance at the end of 2020 on how equity should be used in the event of resolution of CCPs in a manner that minimises the risk of legal challenge by equity holders resulting from the application of the &apos;no creditor worse off&apos; principle. Following the publication of that guidance, the Commission should review the application of the rules laid down in this Regulation with regard to the write-down of equity in resolution by taking into account those internationally agreed standards. In addition to this specific review, the Commission should review the application of this Regulation after five years from the date of its entry into force, inter alia, by taking into account any further international developments. That general review should cover at least certain core matters related to the recovery and resolution of CCPs, such as financial resources available to resolution authorities to cover non-default losses and the CCPs&apos; own resources to be used in recovery and resolution,</p>

                        <p>Without prejudice to the responsibility of clearing members to take losses which go beyond the default waterfall, where a CCP in recovery caused by a non-default event has applied the arrangements and measures to reduce the value of any gains payable by the CCP to non-defaulting clearing members set out in its recovery plan, and as a result has not entered into resolution, the competent authority of the CCP may require the CCP to recompense the clearing members for their loss through cash payments or, where appropriate, may require the CCP to issue instruments recognising a claim on the future profits of the CCP. The possibility to provide recompense to non-defaulting clearing members shall not apply to their contractually committed losses in the default management or recovery phases.</p>

The instruments recognising a claim on future profits of the CCP shall entitle the possessor to receive payments from the CCP on an annual basis until the loss has been recouped, if possible in full, subject to an appropriate maximum number of years from the date of issuance. If the non-defaulting clearing members have passed on the excess losses to their clients, the non-defaulting clearing members shall be obliged to pass the payments received by the CCP on to their clients, to the extent that the losses being recompensed are related to client positions. An appropriate maximum share of the CCP&apos;s annual profits shall be used towards payments relating to those instruments.</p>

If the competent authority decides to grant such authorisation, it shall indicate the period for which the bridge CCP&apos;s obligation to comply with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 is waived. That period shall not exceed 12 months. During that period, the bridge CCP shall be considered as a qualifying CCP as defined in point (88) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for the purposes of that Regulation.</p>

                                    <p>&apos;If the Commission assesses that there is no need to exclude exchange-traded derivatives from the scope of Articles 35 and 36 in accordance with Article 52(12), a CCP or a trading venue may, before 11 February 2021, apply to its competent authority for permission to avail itself of transitional arrangements. The competent authority, taking into account the risks resulting from the application of the access rights under Article 35 or 36 as regards exchange-traded derivatives to the orderly functioning of the relevant CCP or trading venue, may decide that Article 35 or 36 would not apply to the relevant CCP or trading venue, respectively, in respect of exchange-traded derivatives, for a transitional period until 3 July 2021. Where such a transitional period is approved, the CCP or trading venue shall not benefit from the access rights under Article 35 or 36, as regards exchange-traded derivatives for the duration of that period. The competent authority shall notify ESMA and, in the case of a CCP, the college of competent authorities for that CCP, when a transitional period is approved.&apos;.</p>
