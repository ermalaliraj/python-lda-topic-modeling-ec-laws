               <p>On 21 March 2013, an application was submitted to the Commission for authorisation of the use of gamma-glutamyl-valyl-glycine [FL-no: 17.038] as a flavouring substance. The application was notified to the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) for its opinion. The application was also made available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.</p>

               <p>The Union list referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 is intended to regulate only the use of flavouring substances which are added to food in order to impart or modify odour and/or taste. Substance [FL-no: 17.038] could also be added to food for other purposes than flavouring and such uses remain subject to other rules. This Regulation lays down conditions of use which relate solely to the use of [FL-no: 17.038] as a flavouring substance.</p>
