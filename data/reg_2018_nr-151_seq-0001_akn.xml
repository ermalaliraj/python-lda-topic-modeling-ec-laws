               <p>In accordance with Article 26(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is to be ensured.

               <p>In 2013, the Commission carried out an assessment of the Union legal framework for the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles which showed that the framework established by Directive 2007/46/EC is appropriate for achieving the main goals of harmonisation, effective functioning of the internal market and fair competition, and concluded that it should therefore continue to apply.</p>

               <p>That assessment also concluded, however, that there is a need to introduce market surveillance provisions to complement the type-approval requirements; a need to clarify the recall and safeguard procedures, as well as the conditions for granting extensions to approvals for existing types of vehicle; a need to improve the enforcement of the framework for type-approval by harmonising and enhancing the type-approval procedures and conformity of production procedures applied by Member States&apos; authorities and technical services; a need to clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of economic operators in the supply chain, and of the authorities and parties involved in the enforcement of the framework, guaranteeing the independence of those authorities and parties, and preventing conflicts of interest; and a need to improve the suitability of alternative approval schemes (national small series and individual vehicle approvals) and the suitability of the multi-stage type-approval process to provide appropriate flexibility for niche markets and small and medium-sized enterprises without, however, distorting the level playing field.</p>

               <p>This Regulation should strengthen the current framework for EU type-approval, in particular through the introduction of provisions on market surveillance. Market surveillance in the automotive sector should be introduced by specifying the obligations of the economic operators in the supply chain, the responsibilities of the enforcement authorities in the Member States, and the measures to be taken when automotive products are encountered on the market that represent serious safety or environmental risks, that undermine the protection of consumers, or that do not comply with the type-approval requirements.</p>

               <num>(11)</num>
               <p>In order to ensure an effective implementation of the type-approval requirements, the current provisions on conformity of production should be enhanced by, <i>inter alia</i>, providing for mandatory periodic audits of the conformity control methods and of the continued conformity of the automotive products concerned and, by reinforcing the requirements relating to the competence, obligations and performance of the technical services that carry out tests for whole-vehicle type-approval under the responsibility of approval authorities. The proper functioning of technical services is crucial for ensuring a high level of safety and of environmental protection and citizens&apos; confidence in the system. The criteria for designation of technical services provided by Directive 2007/46/EC should be laid down in this Regulation in greater detail in order to ensure that they are applied consistently in all Member States. The assessment methods of the technical services in Member States have a tendency to differ progressively due to the increased complexity of their work. Therefore, it is necessary to provide for procedural obligations that ensure an exchange of information, and monitoring of Member States&apos; practices for, the assessment, designation, notification and monitoring of their technical services. Those procedural obligations should remove any existing discrepancies in the methods used by, and in the interpretation of the criteria for the designation of, technical services. In order to ensure adequate oversight and a level playing-field across the Union, the assessment of an applicant technical service should include an on-site assessment.</p>

               <p>In the case of multi-stage type-approvals, it is essential to verify that changes made before the final stage of completion do not affect the functioning of type-approved systems, components or separate technical units in a way that would invalidate the type-approval previously granted.</p>

               <p>The need for control and monitoring of technical services has increased because technical progress has increased the risk of technical services not possessing the necessary competence to test new technologies or devices that emerge within their scope of designation. As technical progress shortens product cycles and as the intervals of surveillance on-site assessments and of the monitoring vary, the validity of the designation of technical services should be limited in time, which should ensure that the competence of technical services is periodically assessed.</p>

               <p>The designation and monitoring of technical services by the Member States, in accordance with detailed and strict criteria, should therefore be subject to supervisory controls, <i>inter alia</i> as a condition for the renewal of their designation. The position of technical services vis-à-vis manufacturers should be strengthened, including their right and duty to carry out unannounced factory inspections and to conduct physical or laboratory tests on automotive products covered by this Regulation, in order to ensure continuous compliance by manufacturers after they have obtained a type-approval for their automotive products.</p>

Member States should consult each other and the Commission on questions with general relevance for the implementation of this Regulation and inform each other and the Commission.

               <p>Closer coordination between national authorities through information exchange and coordinated assessments under the direction of a coordinating authority is fundamental in order to ensure a consistently high level of safety and of health and environmental protection within the internal market. It would also lead to more efficient use of scarce resources at national level. For this purpose, an advisory Forum should be established for Member States and the Commission with the objective of promoting best practices, exchanging information and coordinating activities related to the enforcement of type-approval legislation. The currently informal cooperation between Member States in that respect would benefit from a more formal framework. The Forum should be composed of representatives appointed by the Member States representing their approval authorities and market surveillance authorities. The representatives attending a given meeting should be selected on the basis of the issues discussed by the Forum. In order to benefit from a range of views and inputs, it is useful for particular outside observers to be invited on a regular basis to the Forum, whenever those observers&apos; activities are relevant to the issues to be discussed.</p>

               <p>It is of particular importance that national authorities and the Commission consider in-service conformity testing and inspections of vehicles to be part of their compliance verification procedures. The selection of the vehicles that are to be subject to that compliance verification should be based on an appropriate risk assessment which takes account of the seriousness of the possible non-compliance; the likelihood of its occurrence; and other possible indicators, such as the introduction of vehicles with new technology installed, any past history or reports of non-compliance, the results of remote sensing testing and the concerns expressed by recognised third parties.</p>

               <p>In addition, in order to verify compliance with the relevant requirements, the Commission should organise and carry out compliance verification tests and inspections that are independent of those carried out by Member States under their national market surveillance obligations. Where such tests and inspections take place on registered vehicles in agreement with the holder of the vehicle registration certificate, it is important to take into account the fact that modified vehicles might be unsuited to such verification of compliance. It is also important to take into account the implications for the holder of the vehicle registration certificate, especially where the holder is a natural person, in the case of which the suitable way of selecting the vehicles is either by way of a public call or through the Member States&apos; authorities. Where those tests and inspections establish non-compliance, or where it is found that a type-approval has been granted on the basis of incorrect data, the Commission should be entitled to initiate Union-wide remedial actions to restore the conformity of the vehicles concerned, and to investigate the reasons why the type-approval was incorrect. Appropriate funding should be ensured in the general budget of the Union to enable the execution of such compliance verification tests and inspections.</p>
