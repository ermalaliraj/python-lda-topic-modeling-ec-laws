                  </authorialNote> determines detailed rules for the financial implementation of the 11th European Development Fund (&apos;11th EDF&apos;). Those rules concern, inter alia: the applicable principles; the constitution of the 11th EDF resources; the financial actors and entities entrusted with budget-implementation tasks; the financing decisions, commitments and payments; the funding instruments, including procurement, grants, financial instruments and Union trust funds; the presentation of the accounts and accounting; the external audit by the Court of Auditors and discharge by the European Parliament; and the Investment Facility managed by the European Investment Bank (EIB).</p>

               <p>For the sake of simplification and coherence, Regulation (EU) 2015/323 was aligned, as much as possible, with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">
                     <p>Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p>

                  </authorialNote>. That alignment was achieved by means of direct references to those Regulations and has, on the one hand, allowed for the easy identification of specificities in the financial implementation of the 11th EDF and, on the other hand, reduced the diversity of Union funding rules in the area of external action that creates an unnecessary burden for the recipients, the Commission and other actors involved.</p>

In the interest of simplification, the financial regulation applicable to the 11th EDF should be aligned as much as possible with that Regulation. For reasons of legal clarity and taking into consideration the significant number of amendments required for that alignment, Regulation (EU) 2015/323 should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation.</p>

                        <p>By 15 June of the year n + 1, the Commission, taking into account the EIB&apos;s forecasts concerning the management and operation of the Investment Facility, including those interest rates subsidies which are implemented by the EIB, shall establish and communicate to the Council a statement of the commitments, payments, and the annual amount of the calls for contributions made in the year n and to be made in the years n + 1 and n + 2. The Commission shall provide the annual amounts of the contributions by Member State, as well as the amount still to be paid by the EDF, distinguishing between the shares of the EIB and of the Commission. The amounts for the years n + 1 and n + 2 shall be based on the capacity to deliver effectively the proposed level of resources while endeavouring to avoid significant variations between the different years, as well as significant end-of-year balances.</p>
