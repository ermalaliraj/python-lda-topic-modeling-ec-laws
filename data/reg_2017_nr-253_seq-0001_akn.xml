For <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> strain FZB24, <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> strain MBI 600, clayed charcoal, hydrogen peroxide and <i>Urtica</i> spp., no specific MRLs were set nor were those substances included in Annex IV to that Regulation, so the default value of 0,01 mg/kg laid down in Article 18(1)(b) thereof applies.</p>

               <p>The Authority concluded in its reasoned opinion on spinetoram that, as regards its use on scarole, a risk to the consumer could not be excluded. The existing MRL should therefore be kept.</p>

               <p>As regards etridiazole, the Authority could not conclude on the dietary risk assessment for consumers as some information was not available and further consideration by risk managers was required.

               <p>As regards all other applications, the Authority concluded that all requirements with respect to data were met and that the modifications to the MRLs requested by the applicants were acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups. It took into account the most recent information on the toxicological properties of the substances. Neither the lifetime exposure to these substances via consumption of all food products that may contain them, nor the short-term exposure due to high consumption of the relevant products showed that there is a risk that the acceptable daily intake or the acute reference dose is exceeded.</p>
