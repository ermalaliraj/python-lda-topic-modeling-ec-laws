               <p>On 17 November 2017, the European Pillar of Social Rights (the &apos;Pillar&apos;) was jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission as a response to social challenges in Europe. The 20 key principles of the Pillar are structured in three categories: equal opportunities and access to the labour market; fair working conditions; and social protection and inclusion. The 20 principles of the Pillar should guide the actions under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). In order to contribute to the implementation of the Pillar, the ESF+ should support investments in people and systems in the policy areas of employment, education and social inclusion, thereby supporting economic, territorial and social cohesion in accordance with Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).</p>

               <p>At Union level, the European Semester for economic policy coordination (the &apos;European Semester&apos;) is the framework to identify national reform priorities and monitor their implementation. Member States develop their own national multiannual investment strategies in support of those reform priorities. Those strategies should be presented alongside the yearly national reform programmes in order to outline and coordinate priority investment projects to be supported by Union or national funding. They should also help to use Union funding in a coherent manner and to maximise the added value of the financial support to be received, in particular from the programmes supported by the Union under, where relevant, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Cohesion Fund the specific objectives and scope of support of which are set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">

                     <p>Council Decision (EU) 2020/1512 of 13 October 2020 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States (OJ L 344, 19.10.2020, p. 22).</p>

The text of those guidelines has been aligned with the principles of the Pillar, with a view to improving Europe&apos;s competitiveness and making it a better place to invest, create jobs and foster social cohesion. In order to ensure the full alignment of the ESF+ with the objectives of those guidelines, particularly as regards employment, education, training and the fight against social exclusion, poverty and discrimination, the ESF+ should support Member States by taking into account the relevant integrated guidelines and relevant country-specific recommendations adopted pursuant to Article 121(2) and Article 148(2) and (4) TFEU and, where appropriate, the national reform programmes underpinned by national strategies. The ESF+ should also contribute to relevant aspects of the implementation of key Union initiatives and activities, in particular the Commission communications of 10 June 2016 entitled &apos;A new Skills Agenda for Europe&apos;, of 30 September 2020 entitled &apos;European Education Area&apos;, and of 7 October 2020 entitled &apos;A Union of Equality: EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion and participation&apos; as well as the Council Recommendations of 15 February 2016 on the integration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market, of 19 December 2016 on Upskilling Pathways, of 30 October 2020 on A Bridge to Jobs &#45; Reinforcing the Youth Guarantee and of 12 March 2021 on Roma equality, inclusion and participation.</p>

               <p>On 20 June 2017, the Council adopted conclusions entitled &apos;A sustainable European future: the EU response to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development&apos;. The Council underlined the importance of achieving sustainable development across the three dimensions (economic, social and environmental) in a balanced and integrated way. It is vital that sustainable development is mainstreamed into all Union internal and external policy areas and that the Union is ambitious in its policies that address global challenges. The Council welcomed the Commission communication of 22 November 2016 entitled &apos;Next steps for a sustainable European future&apos; as a first step in mainstreaming the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and applying sustainable development as an essential guiding principle for all Union policies, including through its financing instruments. The ESF+ should contribute to the implementation of the SDGs by, inter alia, eradicating extreme forms of poverty (SDG 1); promoting quality and inclusive education (SDG 4); promoting gender equality (SDG 5); promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all (SDG 8); and reducing inequality (SDG 10).</p>

               <p>Recent and ongoing developments have aggravated the structural challenges arising from economic globalisation, social inequalities, the management of migration flows and the increased security threat, clean energy transition, technological change, demographic decline, unemployment, in particular youth unemployment, and an increasingly ageing workforce as well as challenges stemming from growing mismatches between demand and supply of skills and labour in some sectors and regions, experienced especially by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The green and digital transitions and the transformation of European industrial ecosystems are likely to entail many new opportunities, if accompanied by the right skill sets and employment and social policies and actions. Taking into account the changing realities of the world of work, the Union should be prepared for current and future challenges by investing in relevant skills, education, training and lifelong learning making growth more inclusive and by improving employment and social policies, while taking into account economic and industrial sustainability, labour mobility and aiming to establish a gender balanced labour market.</p>

The ESF+ should help progression within education and training and transition to work, should support lifelong learning and employability with a view to facilitating full participation in society for all, and should contribute to competitiveness, including through graduate tracking, and to societal and economic innovation by supporting sustainable initiatives that are capable of being scaled up in those fields and adapted to different target groups such as persons with disabilities. Such help, support and contribution could be achieved, for example, by means of online learning, work-based training, traineeships, dual education and training systems, and apprenticeships as defined in the Council Recommendation of 15 March 2018 on a European Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships, lifelong guidance, skills anticipation in close cooperation with industry, up-to-date training materials and delivery methods, forecasting and graduate tracking, training of educators, validation of learning outcomes and recognition of qualifications and industry-based certifications.</p>

Such support implies mobilising a range of policies targeting the most disadvantaged people regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, age, religion or belief, racial or ethnic origin, in particular marginalised communities such as Roma people, people with disabilities or chronic diseases, homeless people, children and elderly people. The ESF+ should promote the active inclusion of people far from the labour market with a view to ensuring their socio-economic integration. The ESF+ should also be used to enhance timely and equal access to affordable, sustainable and high-quality services that promote the access to housing and person-centred care such as healthcare and long-term care, in particular family and community-based care services.

Member States should also invest in measures aiming to facilitate the transition from school to work as well as adequate capacities of employment services to provide tailor-made and holistic support and better-targeted offers to young people. By fully integrating the Youth Employment Initiative into the ESF+, the delivery of targeted actions for youth employment will be more effective and efficient and the scope will be extended to structural measures and reforms, thus ensuring a better match between support from Union funding and the implementation of the reinforced Youth Guarantee. Upgrading of skills and acquiring new and different skills should help young people seize the opportunities of growing sectors and prepare them for the changing nature of work, while harnessing the opportunities arising from the digital and green transitions and the transformation of the Union industrial ecosystems.

               <p>In order to allow for a rapid response to exceptional or unusual circumstances, as referred to in the Stability and Growth Pact, that may arise during the programming period, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt temporary measures to facilitate the use of support from the ESF+ in response to such circumstances, with a maximum time limit of 18 months. The Commission should adopt the measures that are most appropriate in light of the exceptional or unusual circumstances that a Member State is facing while preserving the objectives of the ESF+, but this should not include amendments to the thematic concentration requirements. Furthermore, the implementing powers in relation to the temporary measures for the use of support from the ESF+ in response to exceptional or unusual circumstances should be conferred on the Commission without committee procedures, given that the scope of application of those measures is determined by the Stability and Growth Pact and is limited to the measures set out in this Regulation. The Commission should also monitor the implementation and assess the appropriateness of the temporary measures. Where the Commission deems it to be necessary to amend this Regulation due to the exceptional or unusual circumstances, the scope of the amendment should not include the thematic concentration requirements related to youth employment nor support for the most deprived persons due to the fact that young people and the most deprived persons are often most adversely affected by such crisis situations. Therefore it is necessary to ensure that those target groups continue to receive an adequate amount of support.</p>
