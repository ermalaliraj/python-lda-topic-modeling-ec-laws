               <p>The CONTAM Panel established an updated group TDI of 2 μg/kg body weight per day for 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters. It noted that this TDI is not exceeded in the adult population. However, a slight exceedance of the TDI was observed in case of the high consumers of the younger age groups and in particular in case of infants receiving formula only.</p>

               <p>3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters are processing contaminants formed during the refinement process of vegetable oils. It is therefore appropriate to establish maximum levels for the presence of 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters in vegetable oils and fats placed on the market for the final consumer or for use as an ingredient in food. As virgin olive oils do not contain glycidyl fatty acid esters, 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters, it is appropriate that neither these new maximum levels for 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters or the existing maximum level for glycidyl fatty acid esters apply to virgin oils</p>

               <p>However, given the possible health concern for infants and young children, it is appropriate to establish a stricter maximum level for vegetable oils and fats, destined for the production of baby food and of processed cereal-based food for infants and young children.</p>

               <p>In order to exclude any possible health concerns as regards infants and young children, in particular taking into account the possible exposure to 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters of infants solely fed on infant formula, it is appropriate to establish specific strict maximum levels<i>,</i> depending on whether they are sold in powder or liquid form, for infant formula, follow-on formula and food for special medical purposes intended for infants and young children.</p>

               <p>Given that the slight exceedance of the TDI was observed in high consumers of the younger age groups and not only in infants receiving formula only, it is appropriate to apply the same strict level to young child formula given that these formula are also consumed by the children younger than 3 years. In addition, it is appropriate to establish the existing maximum level for glycidyl fatty acid esters for infant formula and follow on formula also for young child formula.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, it has recently become evident by scientific publications and occurrence data received, that also fish oil and oils from other marine organisms can contain high levels of glycidyl fatty acid esters and 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters. In order to ensure a high level of human health protection, it is appropriate to establish a maximum level for glycidyl fatty acid esters and 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters in fish oil and oils from other marine organisms.</p>

               <p>Food business operators should be granted enough time to adapt their production processes and therefore it is appropriate that the maximum levels for 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters and the new maximum levels of glycidyl esters in young child formula and fish oil and oils from other marine organisms only apply from 1 January 2021. Furthermore, it is appropriate to allow products not complying with the maximum levels for 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters and placed on the market before that date to remain on the market until their date of minimum durability or use-by-date. However, given that glycidyl fatty acid esters are genotoxic carcinogens, and consequently their presence is a higher risk for public health, products not complying with the new maximum levels for glycidyl fatty acid esters and placed on the market before 1 January 2021 should only be allowed to remain on the market for a limited period of time.</p>
