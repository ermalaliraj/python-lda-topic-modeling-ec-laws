               <p>Regulation (EU) 2016/72 fixes the total allowable catch (TAC) for sandeel at zero. Sandeel is a short-lived species and scientific advice only became available on 22 February, while the fishery starts in April. The catch limits for this species should now be amended in line with the scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). According to ICES, real-time monitoring is scientifically suitable for establishing the abundance of sandeel in management area 1, and results could be used to re-evaluate that scientific advice and to set an in-year TAC. However, that requires sufficient data (catches and biological sampling). The catch limit for sandeel in management area 1 should thus be set at a level allowing the collection of sufficient data on stock abundance.</p>

               <p>According to the scientific advice from ICES, catches of small-eyed ray within ICES divisions VIId and VIIe-k and of blonde ray within ICES subarea IV should be reduced. As a consequence, local management measures limiting catches and providing better scientific information should be developed. ICES advised that in divisions VIIf and VIIg catches of small-eyed ray should be limited to no more than 188 tonnes. Therefore, it is appropriate to modify the corresponding fishing opportunities tables to allow for such catches and landings and to adapt the reporting provisions accordingly.</p>

Therefore, it is appropriate to correct the initial TAC in the fishing opportunities table in order to allow for an increased level of catches corresponding to the scientific advice from ICES.</p>
