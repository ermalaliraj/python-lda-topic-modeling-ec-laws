                  </authorialNote> amending Decision 2013/184/CFSP, whereby it imposed further restrictive measures on Myanmar/Burma in the form of a prohibition on the export of dual-use goods for military and Border Guard Police end-users, restrictions on the export of equipment for monitoring communications that might be used for internal repression, and targeted restrictive measures against certain natural persons from the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw) and the Border Guard Police responsible for serious human rights violations, responsible for obstructing the provision of humanitarian assistance to civilians in need and responsible for obstructing the conduct of independent investigations into alleged serious human rights violations or abuses, as well as persons, entities or bodies associated with them.</p>

Certain measures provided for in Decision (CFSP) 2018/655 fall within the scope of the Treaty and therefore, with a view, in particular, to ensuring their uniform application by economic operators in all Member States, regulatory action at the level of the Union is necessary in order to implement them.</p>

               <p>The passage of humanitarian assistance for civilians in need, subject to control of the parties to the conflict and in accordance with international humanitarian law, should not be impeded. It is thus appropriate to apply restrictions on natural persons from the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw) responsible for obstructing the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance for civilians in need. Such restrictions should not unduly affect the delivery of humanitarian assistance and should be applied in full consideration of human rights law and of the applicable rules of international humanitarian law.</p>
