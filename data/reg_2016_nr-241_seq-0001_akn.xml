Where requirements constitute terms and conditions for connection to national networks, Article 37(6) of the same Directive requires regulatory authorities to be responsible for fixing or approving at least the methodologies used to calculate or establish them. In order to provide system security within the interconnected transmission system, it is essential to establish a common understanding of the requirements for High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) systems and direct current-connected power park modules (DC-connected power park modules). Those requirements that contribute to maintaining, preserving and restoring system security in order to facilitate proper functioning of the internal electricity market within and between synchronous areas, and to achieve cost efficiencies, should be regarded as cross-border network issues and market integration issues.</p>

               <p>System security depends partly on the technical capabilities of HVDC systems and DC-connected power park modules. Therefore regular coordination at the level of the transmission and distribution networks and adequate performance of the equipment connected to the transmission and distribution networks with sufficient robustness to cope with disturbances and to help to prevent any major disruption or to facilitate restoration of the system after a collapse are fundamental prerequisites.</p>

               <p>Secure system operation is only possible if there is close cooperation between owners of HVDC systems and DC-connected power park modules and system operators. In particular, the functioning of the system under abnormal operating conditions depends on the response of the HVDC systems and DC-connected power park modules to deviations from the reference 1 per unit (pu) values of voltage and nominal frequency. In the context of system security, the networks and the HVDC systems and DC-connected power park modules should be considered as one entity from a system engineering point of view, given that those parts are interdependent. Therefore, as a prerequisite for grid connection, relevant technical requirements should be set for HVDC systems and DC-connected power park modules.</p>

               <p>Different synchronous electricity systems in the Union have different characteristics which need to be taken into account when setting the requirements for HVDC systems and DC-connected power park modules.

               <p>Due to its cross-border impact, this Regulation should aim at the same frequency-related requirements for all voltage levels, at least within a synchronous area.

               <p>In the case of DC-connected power park modules, new modules could, in the future form part of a meshed off-shore grid connecting to more than one synchronous area. In this case, certain technical requirements should be set in order to maintain system security and ensure that future meshed networks can be developed cost-effectively. However, for certain requirements, DC-connected power park modules should only be required to fit the equipment needed for system security at the time it becomes necessary.</p>

                        <p>With regards to frequency response, the remote-end HVDC converter station owner and the DC-connected power park module owner shall agree on the technical modalities of the fast signal communication in accordance with Article 39(1). Where the relevant TSO requires, the HVDC system shall be capable of providing the network frequency at the connection point as a signal. For an HVDC system connecting a power park module the adjustment of active power frequency response shall be limited by the capability of the DC-connected power park modules.</p>

                        <p>Prior to the application of any requirement set out in this Regulation to existing HVDC systems or DC-connected power park modules in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 4, the relevant TSO shall undertake a qualitative comparison of costs and benefits related to the requirement under consideration. This comparison shall take into account available network-based or market-based alternatives. The relevant TSO may only proceed to undertake a quantitative cost-benefit analysis in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5, if the qualitative comparison indicates that the likely benefits exceed the likely costs. If, however, the cost is deemed high or the benefit is deemed low, then the relevant TSO shall not proceed further.</p>

                     <p>Each regulatory authority shall specify, after consulting relevant system operators, HVDC system owners and DC-connected power park module owners and other stakeholders whom it deems affected by this Regulation, the criteria for granting derogations pursuant to Articles 79 to 81. It shall publish those criteria on its website and notify them to the Commission within nine months of the entry into force of this Regulation. The Commission may require a regulatory authority to amend the criteria if it considers that they are not in line with this Regulation. This possibility to review and amend the criteria for granting derogations shall not affect the derogations already granted which shall continue to apply until the scheduled expiry date as detailed in the decision granting the exemption.</p>

                     <p>If the regulatory authority deems that it is necessary due to a change in circumstances relating to the evolution of system requirements, it may review and amend at most once every year the criteria for granting derogations in accordance with paragraph 1. Any changes to the criteria shall not apply to derogations for which a request has already been made.</p>

                     <p>The regulatory authority may attach any conditions to a decision concerning request for a derogation referred to in paragraph 1. This may include a condition that the development of the connection into a multi-terminal network, or that connection of a further power park module at the same point, will cause the derogation to be evaluated by the regulatory authority or to expire. The regulatory authority shall take into account the need to optimise the configuration between the DC-connected power park module and the remote-end HVDC converter station, as well as the legitimate expectations of the DC-connected power park module owner when adopting a decision concerning a request for a derogation.</p>
