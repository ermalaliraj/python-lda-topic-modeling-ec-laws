               <p>The movement of goods, including waste, is accompanied by a large amount of information which is still exchanged in paper format among businesses, and between businesses and competent authorities. The use of paper documents represents a significant administrative burden for logistics operators and an additional cost for logistics operators and related industries (such as trade and manufacturing), in particular for SMEs, and has a negative impact on the environment.</p>

               <p>The absence of a uniform legal framework at Union level requiring competent authorities to accept relevant freight transport information, required by legislation, in electronic form, is considered to be the main reason for the lack of progress towards the simplification and greater efficiency of information exhanges made possible by available electronic means. The acceptance by competent authorities of information in electronic form with common specifications would ease not only communication between competent authorities and economic operators but, indirectly, also the development of uniform and simplified business-to-business electronic communication across the Union. It would also lead to significant administrative cost savings for economic operators, and particularly SMEs, which constitute the large majority of transport and logistics companies within the Union.</p>

               <p>Some areas of Union transport law require competent authorities to accept digitised information, but this concerns far from all relevant Union legal acts. It should be possible to use electronic means to make regulatory information on the transport of goods available to competent authorities throughout the territory of the Union in respect of all relevant phases of transport operations conducted within the Union. Furthermore, that possibility should apply to all regulatory information and to all transport modes.</p>

               <p>Competent authorities should therefore be required to accept information made available electronically whenever economic operators are obliged to make information available as proof of compliance with requirements laid down in Union legal acts covered by this Regulation. This requirement should also cover information requested by the authorities as additional information in accordance with the provisions of those Union legal acts, for example, when some information is missing. The same should apply where national law requires the provision of regulatory information identical, in whole or in part, to information to be provided pursuant to Union legal acts falling within the scope of this Regulation. Authorities should also endeavour to communicate electronically with the economic operators concerned in relation to that information. Such communication should be without prejudice to relevant provisions of Union legal acts and national law related to follow-up measures during or after regulatory information checks. The obligation for competent authorities to accept information made available electronically by economic operators should also apply whenever provisions of Union legal acts or national law falling within the scope of this Regulation require information that is also referred to in relevant international conventions such as the conventions governing the international contracts of carriage in the different transport modes, for example the UN Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (CMR), the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF), the IATA Resolution 672 on E-air Waybill, the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air (Montreal Convention), and the Budapest Convention on the Contract for the Carriage of Goods by Inland Waterways (CMNI).</p>

               <p>The use of electronic means to exchange regulatory information can reduce administrative costs for economic operators and can enhance the efficiency of competent authorities. Both economic operators and competent authorities would need to take the necessary measures to make possible electronic exchanges of regulatory freight transport information (eFTI) in machine-readable format via platforms based on information and communications technology (eFTI platforms), including acquiring the necessary equipment. However, the economic operators concerned should remain responsible for providing information in human-readable format whenever specifically requested by competent authorities in order to allow competent authorities to perform their duties in situations where access to an eFTI platform is not available.</p>

Those access points would act only as intermediaries between the eFTI platforms and competent authorities, and should therefore neither store nor process the eFTI data to which they mediate access, except for metadata connected to eFTI data processing, such as operation logs necessary for monitoring or statistical purposes.

Those requirements should ensure, in particular, that all eFTI data can be processed solely in accordance with a comprehensive rights-based access-control system that provides assigned functionalities, that all competent authorities can have immediate access to that data in accordance to their respective regulatory enforcement competences, that the processing by electronic means of personal data can be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="6">

Therefore, the Commission should assess possible initiatives with a view to establishing an obligation for economic operators to use electronic means to make regulatory information available to competent authorities. The Commission should propose, where appropriate, corresponding initiatives, including possible amendments to this Regulation and other relevant Union legal acts. With a view to improving the enforcement capabilities of competent authorities and minimising costs for both competent authorities and the economic operators, the Commission should also consider further measures such as enhanced interoperability of and a common access point to ICT systems and platforms used for recording and processing regulatory information as provided for in other Union transport law.</p>

The timely adoption of those delegated and implementing acts is essential for the Member States and economic operators to have enough time to take the necessary measures in compliance with this Regulation.
