               <p>An application for authorisation of the use of potassium carbonate (E 501) on peeled, cut and shredded fruit and vegetables was submitted on 15 October 2015 and was made available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.</p>

               <p>During preparation of fresh cut fruit and vegetables, enzymatic activities may lead to a loss in quality of the products, such as browning and structural losses and to food waste. In order to avoid browning, ascorbic acid (E 300) can be used. However, ascorbic acid tends to break down cell tissue, leading to softening and discoloration of fruit and vegetables after a few days. The use of potassium carbonate (E 501) allows for a more efficient protection against browning as it functions as a stabilizer and acidity regulator and minimizes the damage to tissue caused by ascorbic acid.</p>

               <p>Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (&apos;the Authority&apos;) in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since authorisation of use of potassium carbonate (E 501) as stabilizer and acidity regulator on peeled, cut and shredded fruit and vegetables constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the Authority.</p>

               <p>Therefore, it is appropriate to authorise the use of potassium carbonate (E 501) as stabilizer and acidity regulator in the food category 04.1.2 &apos;Peeled, cut and shredded fruit and vegetables&apos; in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 at <i>quantum satis</i>. In order to ensure that the consumer is informed about this treatment, the use of potassium carbonate (E 501) should be restricted to prepacked refrigerated unprocessed fruit and vegetables ready for consumption and prepacked unprocessed and peeled potatoes.</p>
