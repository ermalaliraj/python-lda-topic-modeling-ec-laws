               <p>On 4 August 2014, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the use of polyglycerol polyricinoleate (E 476) as an emulsifier in emulsified sauces. The application was subsequently made available to the Member States by the Commission pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.</p>

               <p>Fat reduction in processed food, such as emulsified sauces, is normally achieved by the use of thickeners. However, thickeners lead to an undesirable modification of the organoleptic properties of the food when used above a certain concentration. An additional reduction of fat content can be achieved in some foods, such as emulsified sauces, by the use of emulsifiers capable of stabilising a high content of water inside fat. In studies carried out by the applicant comparing the effectiveness of different emulsifiers for further fat reduction in emulsified sauces, polyglycerol polyricinoleate (E 476) gave the best results both in terms of physical as well as organoleptic properties of the obtained emulsified sauce. The level of polyglycerol polyricinoleate (E 476) needed to achieve the intended technological function was 4000 mg/kg.</p>

               <p>On 27 May 2016, the Commission requested the Authority to evaluate the safety of the proposed extension of use of polyglycerol polyricinoleate (E 476) in emulsified sauces in addition to the re-evaluation of the safety of this substance pursuant to Commission Regulation (EU) No 257/2010.</p>

               <p>On 24 March 2017, the Authority delivered a Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of polyglycerol polyricinoleate (E 476)<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">
                     <p>EFSA Journal 2017;15(3):4743.</p>
                  </authorialNote> and established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 25 mg polyglycerol polyricinoleate/kg body weight/day. Considering that the exposure estimates did not exceed the ADI, the Authority concluded that polyglycerol polyricinoleate (E 476) as a food additive would not be of safety concern if used at the permitted or reported use and use levels. The Authority also concluded that the additional use of polyglycerol polyricinoleate (E 476) at the maximum level of 4000 mg/kg in emulsiÔ¨Åed sauces would not result in a total exposure to this substance exceeding the ADI. Consequently, the extension of use for polyglycerol polyricinoleate (E 476) in emulsified sauces is not of safety concern.</p>

               <p>In addition, the Authority recommended several amendments to the specifications of polyglycerol polyricinoleate (E 476) in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">
                     <p>Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 of 9 March 2012 laying down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 83, 22.3.2012, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote>. These are to a large extent linked to the use of glycerol in the manufacturing process of polyglycerol polyricinoleate (E 476) and are therefore similar to the recommendations made by the Authority in its Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of glycerol (E 422)<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="6">
                     <p>EFSA Journal 2017;15(3):4720.</p>
                  </authorialNote>. Consequently, the amendment of the specifications of polyglycerol polyricinoleate (E 476), in line with the recommendations of the Authority, will be addressed separately, together with the specifications of glycerol (E 422) and of other glycerol-based food additives.</p>
