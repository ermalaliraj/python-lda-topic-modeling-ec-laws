                  </authorialNote> adopted the list of flavouring substances and introduced that list in Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008.</p>

               <p>That list may be updated in accordance with the common procedure referred to in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application submitted by a Member State or by an interested party.</p>

               <p>On 10 August 2012, an application was submitted to the Commission for authorisation of the use of 3-(1-((3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)methyl)-1<i>H</i>-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-(3-hydroxybenzyl)imidazolidine-2,4-dione, (FL No 16.127), as a flavouring substance in various foods falling, in substance, under a number of the food categories referred to in the Union list of flavourings and source materials. The Commission notified the application to the European Food Safety Authority (&apos;the Authority&apos;) and requested its opinion. The Commission also made the application available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.</p>

                     <p>EFSA Journal 2016;14(7):4334.</p>
                  </authorialNote> evaluated the safety of substance FL No 16.127, concluded that its use does not give rise to safety concerns when limited to levels up to those specified for various foods in different food categories. The Authority also noted that it is a substance with flavouring modifying properties.</p>

               <num>(6)</num>
               <p>Since the use of substance FL No 16.127 as a flavouring substance does not give rise to safety concerns with the specified conditions of use and it is not expected to mislead the consumer, it is appropriate to authorise such use in the light of the Opinion of the Authority.</p>
