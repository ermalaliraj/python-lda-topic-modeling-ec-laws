               <p>Space technology, data and services have become indispensable in the daily lives of Europeans and play an essential role in preserving many strategic interests. The Union&apos;s space industry is already one of the most competitive in the world. However, the emergence of new players and the development of new technologies are revolutionising traditional industrial models. Therefore, for the Union to remain a leading international player with extensive freedom of action in the space domain, it is crucial that it encourages scientific and technical progress and supports the competitiveness and innovation capacity of space sector industries within the Union, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), start-ups and innovative businesses.</p>

               <p>The possibilities that space offers for the security of the Union and its Member States should be exploited, as referred to in particular in the Global Strategy for the European Union&apos;s Foreign and Security Policy of June 2016, while retaining the civil nature of the Union Space Programme (&apos;the Programme&apos;) and respecting the possible neutrality or non-alignment provisions stipulated in the constitutional law of Member States. Historically, the space sector&apos;s development has been linked to security. In many cases, the equipment, components and instruments used in the space sector, as well as space data and services, are dual-use. However, the Union&apos;s security and defence policy is determined within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, in accordance with Title V of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).</p>

               <p>The Union has been developing its own space initiatives and programmes since the end of the 1990s, namely the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and then Galileo and Copernicus, which respond to the needs of Union citizens and the requirements of public policies. The continuity of those initiatives and programmes should be ensured and the services they provide should be improved, so that they meet the new needs of users, remain at the forefront in view of new technology development and the transformations in the digital and information and communications technology domains, and are able to meet political priorities such as climate change, including monitoring changes in the polar region, transport, security and defence.</p>

               <p>It is necessary to exploit synergies between the transport, space and digital sectors in order to foster the broader use of new technologies, such as e-call, digital tachograph, traffic supervision and management, autonomous driving and unmanned vehicles and drones, and to respond to the need of secure and seamless connectivity, robust positioning, inter modality and interoperability. Such exploitation of synergies would enhance the competitiveness of transport services and industry.</p>

               <p>To reap the maximum benefits of the Programme, in all Member States and by all their citizens, it is also essential to promote the use and the uptake of the data, information and services provided, as well as to support the development of downstream applications based on those data, information and services. To that end, the Member States, the Commission and the entities responsible could, in particular, periodically run information campaigns regarding the benefits of the Programme.</p>

               <p>To achieve the objectives of freedom of action, independence and security, it is essential that the Union benefits from an autonomous access to space and is able to use it safely. It is therefore essential that the Union supports autonomous, reliable and cost-effective access to space, especially as regards critical infrastructure and technology, public security and the security of the Union and its Member States. The Commission should therefore have the possibility to aggregate launch services at European level, both for its own needs and, at their request, for those of other entities, including Member States, in accordance with Article 189(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market, it is also crucial that the Union continues to have access to modern, efficient and flexible launch infrastructure facilities and benefits from appropriate launch systems. Therefore, without prejudice to measures taken by Member States or the European Space Agency (ESA), it should be possible for the Programme to support adaptations to the space ground infrastructure, including new developments, which are necessary for the implementation of the Programme and adaptations, including technology development, to space launch systems which are necessary for launching satellites, including alternative technologies and innovative systems, for the implementation of the Programme&apos;s components. Those activities should be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">

               <p>To strengthen the competitiveness of the Union space industry and increase capacity in designing, building and operating its own systems, the Union should support the creation, growth, and development of the entire space industry. The emergence of a business- and innovation-friendly model should be supported at European, regional and national levels by initiatives such as space hubs that bring together the space, digital and other sectors, as well as users. Those space hubs should aim to foster entrepreneurship and skills while pursuing synergies with the digital innovation hubs. The Union should foster the creation and expansion of Union-based space companies to help them succeed, including by supporting them in accessing risk finance in view of the lack of appropriate access within the Union to private equity for space start-ups and by fostering demand, known as the first contract approach.</p>

               <p>The space value chain is generally segmented between upstream activities and downstream activities. Upstream activities comprise those leading to an operational space system, including development, manufacturing and launch activities and the operations of such a system. Downstream activities comprise those covering the provision of space-related services, and products to users. Digital platforms are also an important element supporting the development of the space sector. They allow access to data and products as well as toolboxes, storage and computing facilities.</p>

               <p>Owing to the Programme&apos;s coverage and its potential to help resolve global challenges, space activities have a strong international dimension. In close coordination with the Member States, and with their agreement, the relevant bodies of the Programme might participate in matters pertaining to the Programme, in international cooperation and to collaborate in relevant sectoral bodies of the United Nations (UN). For matters relating to the Programme, the Commission might coordinate, on behalf of the Union and in its field of competence, the activities on the international scene, in particular to defend the interests of the Union and its Member States in international fora, including in the area of frequencies as regards the Programme, without prejudice to Member States&apos; competence in that area. It is particularly important for the Union, represented by the Commission, to collaborate in the bodies of the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme.</p>

International cooperation is a key element of the Space Strategy for Europe, as set out by the Commission in its Communication of 26 October 2016. The Commission should use the Programme to contribute to and benefit from international efforts through initiatives, to promote European technology and industry internationally, for example bi-lateral dialogues, industry workshops and support for SME internationalisation, and to facilitate access to international markets and foster fair competition, also leveraging economic diplomacy initiatives. European space diplomacy initiatives should be in full coherence and complementarity with the existing Union policies, priorities and instruments, while the Union has a key role to play, together with Member States, in remaining at the forefront of the international scene.</p>

Therefore, cumulative funding from those programmes should be provided for, provided that they do not cover the same cost items, in particular through arrangements for complementary funding from Union programmes where management modalities permit - either in sequence, in an alternating way, or through the combination of funds including for the joint funding of actions, allowing, where possible, innovation partnerships and blending operations. During the implementation of the Programme, the Commission should therefore promote synergies with other related Union programmes and financial instruments, which would allow, where possible, use of access to risk finance, innovation partnerships, and cumulative or blended funding.

The Union should support activities relating to research and technology development, or the early phases of evolution relating to the infrastructures established under the Programme, as well as the research and development activities relating to applications and services based on the systems established under the programme, thereby stimulating upstream and downstream economic activities. The appropriate instrument at Union level to finance those research and innovation activities is Horizon Europe. However, a very specific part of development activities should be financed from the budget allocated to the Galileo and EGNOS components under this Regulation, in particular where such activities concern fundamental elements such as Galileo-enabled chipsets and receivers, which would facilitate the development of applications across different sectors of the economy. Such financing should nevertheless not jeopardise the deployment or exploitation of the infrastructures established under the Programme.</p>

               <p>As the Programme is, in principle, financed by the Union, procurement contracts concluded under the Programme for activities financed by the Programme should comply with Union rules. In that context, the Union should also be responsible for defining the objectives to be pursued as regards public procurement. The Financial Regulation provides that, on the basis of the results of an ex ante assessment, the Commission is to be able to rely on the systems and the procedures of the persons or entities implementing Union funds. Specific adjustments necessary to those systems and procedures, as well as the arrangements for the prolongation of the existing contracts, should be defined in the corresponding financial framework partnership agreement (FFPA) or contribution agreement.</p>

               <p>The Programme relies on complex and constantly changing technologies. The reliance on such technologies results in uncertainty and risk for public contracts concluded under the Programme, insofar as those contracts involve long-term commitments to equipment or services. Specific measures concerning public contracts are therefore required in addition to the rules laid down in the Financial Regulation. It should thus be possible to award a contract in the form of a conditional stage-payment contract, introduce an amendment, under certain conditions, in the context of its performance, or impose a minimum level of subcontracting, particularly in order to enable SMEs and start-ups to participate. Finally, given the technological uncertainties that characterise the Programme&apos;s components, contract prices cannot always be forecast accurately and it should therefore be possible to conclude contracts without stipulating a firm fixed price and to include clauses to safeguard the financial interests of the Union.</p>

That governance should be based on three key principles. Firstly, it is imperative that Member States&apos; extensive, unique experience in security matters be taken into consideration to the greatest possible extent. Secondly, in order to prevent conflicts of interest and any shortcomings in applying security rules, operational functions should be segregated from security accreditation functions. Thirdly, the entity in charge of managing all or part of the Programme&apos;s components is also the best placed to manage the security of the tasks entrusted to it. The security of the Programme would build upon the experience gained in the implementation of Galileo, EGNOS and Copernicus over the past years. Sound security governance also requires that roles be appropriately distributed among the various players. As it is responsible for the Programme, the Commission, without prejudice to Member States prerogatives in the area of national security, should determine the general security requirements applicable to each of the Programme&apos;s components.</p>

               <p>Following the requests of the European Parliament and of the Council, the Union established a support framework for space surveillance and tracking (SST) by means of Decision No 541/2014/EU. Space debris has become a serious threat to the security, safety and sustainability of space activities. The SST sub-component is therefore essential to preserving the continuity of the Programme&apos;s components and their contributions to Union policies. By seeking to prevent the proliferation of space debris, the SST sub-component contributes to ensuring the sustainable and guaranteed access to and use of space, which is a global common objective.

A SWE sub-component should therefore be established as part the Programme with an aim of assessing the space weather risks and corresponding user needs, raising the awareness of space weather risks, ensuring the provision of user-driven SWE services, and improving Member States&apos; capabilities to provide the SWE services. The Commission should prioritise the sectors to which the operational SWE services are to be provided taking into account the user needs, risks and technological readiness. In the long term, the needs of other sectors may be addressed. The provision of services at Union level according to the users&apos; needs would require targeted, coordinated and continued research and development activities to support SWE services evolution.

                  </authorialNote>, this Programme should be evaluated on the basis of information collected in accordance with specific monitoring requirements, while avoiding administrative burden, in particular on Member States, and overregulation. Those requirements, where appropriate, should include measurable indicators as a basis for evaluating the effects of the Programme on the ground.</p>

               <p>The use of Copernicus and Galileo-based services is predicted to have a major impact in the European economy in general. However, ad hoc measurements and case studies seem to dominate the picture today. The Commission (Eurostat) should define relevant statistical measurements and indicators that would form the basis for monitoring the impact of the Union&apos;s space activities in a systematic and authoritative way.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission relating to the reallocation of funds between the categories of expenditure of the Programme&apos;s budget, the adoption of contribution decisions regarding the contribution agreements, determining the technical and operational requirements needed for the implementation of and evolution of the Programme&apos;s components and of the services they provide, deciding on the FFPA, the adoption of measures necessary for the smooth functioning of Galileo and EGNOS and their adoption by the market, the adoption of the detailed provisions concerning the access to SST services and relevant procedures, the adoption of the multiannual plan and the key performance indicators for development of Union SST services, the adoption of detailed rules on the functioning of the organisational framework of the participation of Member States in the SST sub-component, the selection of SWE services, and the adoption of the work programmes. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. The Commission should be assisted by the Programme committee, which should meet in specific configuration.</p>

               <p>Since the Programme&apos;s components are user-driven, they require the continuous, effective involvement of users for their implementation and development, particularly regarding the definition and validation of service requirements. In order to increase the value for the users, their input should be actively sought through regular consultation with end-users from the public and private sectors of Member States and, where appropriate, with international organisations. For that purpose, a working group (&apos;User Forum&apos;) should be set up to assist the Programme committee with the identification of user requirements, and the verification of service compliance, as well as the identification of gaps in services provided. The rules of procedure of the Programme committee should establish the organisation of the User Forum to take into account the specificities of each of the Programme&apos;s components and each service within the components. Whenever possible, Member States should contribute to the User Forum based on a systematic and coordinated consultation of users at national level.</p>

               <p>As sound public governance requires uniform management of the Programme, faster decision-making and equal access to information, representatives of the entities entrusted with tasks related to the Programme might be able to take part as observers in the work of the Programme committee established in application of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. For the same reasons, representatives of third countries and international organisations who have concluded an international agreement with the Union, relating to the Programme or its components or sub-components, might be able to take part in the work of the Programme committee subject to security constraints and as provided for in the terms of such agreement. The representatives of entities entrusted with tasks related to the Programme, third countries and international organisations should not be entitled to take part in the Programme committee voting procedures. The conditions for the participation of observers and ad hoc participants should be laid down in the rules of procedure of the Programme committee.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure effective assessment of progress of the Programme towards the achievement of its objectives, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of supplementing the provisions on the Copernicus data and Copernicus information to be provided to Copernicus users as regards the specifications and conditions and procedures for the access to and use of such data and such information, of amending the Annex to this Regulation with regard to the indicators where considered necessary and of supplementing this Regulation with provisions on the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation framework. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States&apos; experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the Programme&apos;s security requirements, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. Member States should be able to exert a maximum of control over the Programme&apos;s security requirements. When adopting implementing acts in the area of security of the Programme, the Commission should be assisted by the Programme committee meeting in a dedicated security configuration. In view of the sensitivity of security matters, the chair of the Programme committee should endeavour to find solutions which command the widest possible support within the committee. The Commission should not adopt implementing acts determining the general security requirements of the Programme in cases where no opinion is delivered by the Programme committee.</p>
