                  </authorialNote> in accordance with Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. In that framework, a temporary MRL for cultivated fungi was set at 0,9 mg/kg due to monitoring data showing that residues occurred on untreated cultivated fungi at a level higher than the limit of determination where such residues may result from cross-contamination of cultivated fungi with straw lawfully treated with chlormequat.</p>

               <p>Mushroom growers submitted to the Commission recent monitoring data specifically on oyster mushrooms showing that residues occur in those products at higher levels than the current temporary MRL set for cultivated fungi. Those residues result from a cross-contamination of cultivated fungi with straw lawfully treated with chlormequat. Several Member States submitted additional monitoring data from official controls performed specifically on oyster mushrooms, which confirmed those findings.</p>

               <p>The Authority concluded in its scientific statement that the modification to the MRL requested by Germany was acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups. The Authority took into account the most recent information on the toxicological properties of the substance. Neither the lifetime exposure to this substance via consumption of all food products that may contain it, nor the short-term exposure due to high consumption of the relevant products showed that there is a risk that the acceptable daily intake or the acute reference dose is exceeded.</p>

               <p>In light of the Authority&apos;s conclusions on risk to consumers, the MRL for oyster mushrooms should be set at the level corresponding to the 95th percentile of all the sample results while maintaining the existing MRL for other cultivated fungi. That MRL will be reviewed; the review will take into account the information available within 13 April 2021.</p>
