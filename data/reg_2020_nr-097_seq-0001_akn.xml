               <p>At their annual meeting in July 2019, the Parties to the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) decided on bottom fishing measures and on fishing effort limitation in the SIOFA area. Those measures were implemented in Union law by Regulation (EU) 2020/123. At that meeting, the Parties to the SIOFA also agreed on five interim protected areas in which specific rules apply for fishing vessels in order to protect benthic ecosystems. Therefore, further changes should be made to that Regulation to ensure that implementing rules properly reflect the decisions taken by the Parties to the SIOFA.</p>
