               <p>In order to allow for the proper functioning of the computerised system by ensuring storage of complete, up-to-date and accurate data, it is necessary to amend the scope of Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 in order to set out the information that Member States should introduce in the electronic registers in relation to the certified consignors and certified consignees moving excise goods only occasionally.</p>

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.</p>
