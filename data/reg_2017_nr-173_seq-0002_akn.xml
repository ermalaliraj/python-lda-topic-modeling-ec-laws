               <p>Following an application from Beghin-Meiji and Tereos Syral, submitted pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to short-chain fructooligosaccharides from sucrose and maintenance of normal defecation (Question No EFSA-Q-2015-00377<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">

               <p>On 8 January 2016, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority, which concluded that, on the basis of the data presented, a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of short-chain fructooligosaccharides from sucrose and maintenance of normal defecation under the conditions of use proposed by the applicant. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.</p>
