This Regulation should implement one of the priorities set out in the Commission Communication of 11 December 2019 entitled &apos;The European Green Deal&apos; and is part of the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan that provides dedicated financing under the Just Transition Mechanism in the context of cohesion policy to address the social, economic and environmental costs of the transition to a climate-neutral and circular economy, where any remaining greenhouse gas emissions are compensated by equivalent absorptions.</p>

               <p>The transition to a climate-neutral and circular economy constitutes one of the most important policy objectives for the Union. On 12 December 2019 the European Council endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. While fighting climate change and environmental degradation will benefit all in the long term and provides opportunities and challenges for all in the medium term, not all regions and Member States start their transition from the same point or have the same capacity to respond. Some are more advanced than others, and the transition entails a wider social, economic and environmental impact for those regions that rely heavily on fossil fuels for energy use - especially coal, lignite, peat and oil shale - or greenhouse gas intensive industries. Such a situation not only creates the risk of a variable speed transition in the Union as regards climate action, but also of growing disparities between regions, detrimental to the objectives of social, economic and territorial cohesion.</p>

               <p>In order to be successful and socially acceptable for all, the transition has to be fair and inclusive. Therefore, the Union, Member States and their regions must take into account its social, economic and environmental implications from the outset, and deploy all possible instruments to mitigate adverse consequences. The Union budget has an important role in that regard.</p>

               <p>As set out in the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, a Just Transition Mechanism should complement the other actions under the next multiannual financial framework for the period from 2021 to 2027. It should contribute to addressing the social, economic and environmental consequences, in particular for workers affected in the process of transitioning towards a climate-neutral Union by 2050, by bringing together the Union budget&apos;s spending on climate and social objectives at regional level and by aiming for high social and environmental standards.</p>

               <p>This Regulation should establish the Just Transition Fund (JTF) which is one of the pillars of the Just Transition Mechanism implemented under cohesion policy. The aims of the JTF are to mitigate the adverse effects of the climate transition by supporting the most affected territories and workers concerned and to promote a balanced socio-economic transition. In line with the JTF&apos;s single specific objective, actions supported by the JTF should directly contribute to alleviating the impact of the transition by mitigating the negative repercussions on employment and by financing the diversification and modernisation of the local economy.

Resources from the JTF&apos;s own envelope are additional to the investments needed to achieve the overall target of 30 % of the Union budget expenditure contributing to climate objectives.

               <p>Transitioning to a climate-neutral economy is a challenge for all Member States. It will be particularly demanding for those Member States that rely, or which until recently have relied, heavily on fossil fuels or greenhouse gas intensive industrial activities which need to be phased out or which need to adapt due to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy and that lack the financial means to do so. The JTF should therefore cover all Member States, but the distribution of its financial means should focus on those territories that are the most affected by the climate transition process, and that distribution should reflect the capacity of Member States to finance the necessary investments to cope with the transition towards a climate-neutral economy.</p>

All supported activities should be pursued in full respect of the climate, environmental and social commitments and priorities of the Union. The list of investments should include those that support local economies through stimulating their endogenous growth potential in accordance with the respective smart specialisation strategies, including sustainable tourism where appropriate. Investments need to be sustainable in the long-term, taking into account all the objectives of the European Green Deal. The projects financed should contribute to a transition to a sustainable, climate-neutral and circular economy, including measures that aim to increase resource efficiency. Waste incineration should not receive support given that this activity belongs to the lower part of the waste hierarchy in the circular economy. Consultancy services that contribute to the implementation of measures supported by the JTF should be eligible. Renaturation of sites, development of green infrastructure and water management should be able to be supported as part of a land restoration project. When supporting energy efficiency measures, the JTF should be able to support investments such as those which contribute to reducing energy poverty, principally through energy efficiency improvements of housing stock. The JTF should also be able to support the development of innovative storage technologies.</p>

The JTF should aim to help them adapt to new employment opportunities. The JTF should also provide any appropriate form of support to jobseekers, including job search assistance and their active inclusion into the labour market.

               <p>The territorial just transition plans should identify the territories most negatively affected, where JTF support should be concentrated, and describe specific actions to be undertaken to reach the Union&apos;s 2030 targets for energy and climate and a climate-neutral economy of the Union by 2050, in particular as regards the conversion or closure of facilities involving fossil fuel production or other greenhouse gas intensive activities. Those territories should be precisely defined and correspond to level 3 of the common classification of territorial units for statistics (&apos;NUTS level 3 regions&apos;), as established by Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="14">

The plans should set out the challenges and needs of those territories, taking into account depopulation risks, and identify the type of operations needed to contribute to job creation at the level of the beneficiaries of the plan and in a manner that ensures the coherent development of climate-resilient economic activities that are also consistent with the transition to a climate-neutral economy and the objectives of the European Green Deal. Where such territories are identified, additional attention should be given to the specificities of islands, insular areas as well as the outermost regions, where the geographical and socio-economic characteristics may require a different approach to support the transition process towards a climate-neutral economy. Only investments in accordance with the territorial just transition plans should receive financial support from the JTF. The territorial just transition plans should be part of the programmes, supported, as the case may be, by the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund or the JTF, which are approved by the Commission.</p>
