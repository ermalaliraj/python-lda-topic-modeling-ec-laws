               <p>On 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the &apos;United Kingdom&apos;) submitted the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). The Treaties will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from the date of entry into force of a withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after that notification, unless the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, unanimously decides to extend that period.</p>

               <p>It is necessary to ensure that passengers can be picked up and set down in the border region of Ireland in the course of international regular and special regular passenger transport services between Ireland and Northern Ireland for the same period of six months as initially intended. Therefore, the reference to the end date referred to in point (3)(d) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2019/501 should be replaced by a reference to a period of six months from the date of application of that Regulation.</p>

               <p>Given the extension by seven months of the period provided for in Article 50(3) TEU and in the absence of any adaptations, Regulation (EU) 2019/502 would be applicable for less than half of the initially intended period if it ceased to apply on 30 March 2020. That would significantly limit the period during which United Kingdom carriers would be able to operate flights into the Union. Consequently, in order to reflect the initially envisaged period of application, the period of application of Regulation (EU) 2019/502 should be extended by seven months. In order to coincide with the last day of the IATA summer season of 2020, Regulation (EU) 2019/502 should cease to apply at the latest on 24 October 2020.</p>
