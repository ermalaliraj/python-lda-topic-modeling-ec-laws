                  </authorialNote> amended Regulation (EU) 2020/123 to set preliminary fishing opportunities covering the period from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2020 for Norway pout and associated by-catches in the waters of ICES division 3a and Union waters of ICES division 2a and ICES subarea 4 (&apos;preliminary fishing opportunities&apos;).</p>

               <num>(3)</num>
               <p>As the preliminary fishing opportunities cover only two months of the fishing year, which runs from 1 November to 31 October, they were set far below the annual catch advice provided by ICES.</p>

               <p>The fishing season for Norway pout usually extends from September to January with a peak from October to December. The most recent catch data submitted to the Commission indicates that over 21000 tonnes of Norway pout were caught in October 2020. Extrapolating those numbers according to the historical catch patterns of the Norway pout fishery indicates that the preliminary fishing opportunities are very likely soon to be exhausted and therefore not to be sufficient to cover the fishing activity up to the end of the year. In order to avoid the interruption of fishing activities for this stock before the end of 2020, it is therefore appropriate to adjust the preliminary fishing opportunities according to the most recent estimates, while staying fully in line with the ICES advice.</p>

               <p>The adjusted preliminary fishing opportunities should apply from 1 November. Such retroactive application does not affect the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations as the fishing opportunities concerned are increased.</p>
