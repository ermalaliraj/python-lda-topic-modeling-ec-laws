               <p>In order to enhance the economic and political reform efforts undertaken by Ukraine, and to support and accelerate the development of closer economic relations with the Union, it is appropriate and necessary to increase the trade flows concerning the import of certain agricultural products and to grant concessions in the form of autonomous trade measures for certain industrial products in line with the acceleration of the elimination of customs duties on trade between the Union and Ukraine.</p>

               <p>The Commission has analysed the factual rationale for selecting the products that are to be subject to this Regulation, in particular the potential impact of this Regulation on small and medium-sized beneficiaries in Ukraine, and has provided an explanation thereof to the European Parliament and to the Council. The autonomous trade measures established by this Regulation should be granted for products that are beneficial in light of that analysis. Those autonomous trade measures should take the form of the following preferential arrangements: (i) zero-tariff quotas for the agricultural products listed in Annexes I and II to this Regulation in addition to the zero-tariff quotas set out in the Association Agreement; and (ii) the full removal of import duties (&apos;preferential customs duties&apos;) on importation of the industrial products listed in Annex III to this Regulation.</p>

The period of reintroduction shall not exceed one year, unless it is extended in duly justified circumstances. Where the facts as finally established show that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 of this Article are not met, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act terminating the investigation and proceedings in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 5(2).</p>
