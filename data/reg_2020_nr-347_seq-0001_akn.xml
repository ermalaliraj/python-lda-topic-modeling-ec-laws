               <p>Crowdfunding is increasingly an established form of alternative finance for start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), typically relying on small investments. Crowdfunding represents an increasingly important type of intermediation where a crowdfunding service provider, without taking on own risk, operates a digital platform open to the public in order to match or facilitate the matching of prospective investors or lenders with businesses that seek funding. Such funding could take the form of loans or the acquisition of transferable securities or of other admitted instruments for crowdfunding purposes. It is therefore appropriate to include within the scope of this Regulation both lending-based crowdfunding and investment-based crowdfunding, since those types of crowdfunding can be structured as comparable funding alternatives.</p>

               <p>The provision of crowdfunding services generally involves three types of actors: the project owner that proposes the project to be funded, investors who fund the proposed project, and an intermediating organisation in the form of a crowdfunding service provider that brings together project owners and investors through an online platform.</p>

               <p>Crowdfunding can contribute to providing access to finance for SMEs and completing the Capital Markets Union (CMU). Lack of access to finance for SMEs constitutes a problem even in those Member States where access to bank finance has remained stable throughout the financial crisis. Crowdfunding has emerged and become an established practice of funding business activities of natural and legal persons. Such funding takes place through online platforms; the business activities are typically funded by a large number of people or organisations; and the businesses, including business start-ups, raise relatively small amounts of money.</p>

               <p>In addition to providing an alternative source of financing, including venture capital, crowdfunding can offer other benefits to businesses. It can validate a business idea, give entrepreneurs access to a large number of people providing insights and information, and be a marketing tool.</p>

               <p>Several Member States have already introduced domestic bespoke regimes on crowdfunding. Those regimes are tailored to the characteristics and needs of local markets and investors. As a result, the existing national rules diverge across the Union as regards the conditions of operation of crowdfunding platforms, the scope of permitted activities and the authorisation requirements.</p>

               <p>The differences between the existing national rules are such that they obstruct the cross-border provision of crowdfunding services and thus have a direct effect on the functioning of the internal market in such services. In particular, the fact that the legal framework is fragmented along national borders creates substantial legal costs for retail investors who often face difficulties in determining the rules applicable to cross-border crowdfunding services. Therefore, such investors are often discouraged from investing cross-border by means of crowdfunding platforms. For the same reasons, crowdfunding service providers operating such platforms are discouraged from offering their services in Member States other than the one in which they are established. As a result, crowdfunding services have remained hitherto largely national, to the detriment of a Union-wide crowdfunding market, thus depriving businesses of access to crowdfunding services, especially in cases where those businesses operate in smaller national markets.</p>

               <p>In order to foster cross-border crowdfunding services and to facilitate the exercise of the freedom to provide and receive such services in the internal market, it is necessary to address the existing obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market in crowdfunding services, and to ensure a high level of investor protection by laying down a regulatory framework at Union level.</p>

               <p>The provision of crowdfunding services aims to facilitate the funding of a project by raising capital from a large number of people who each contribute relatively small investment amounts through a publicly accessible internet-based information system. Crowdfunding services are thus open to an unrestricted pool of investors who receive investment propositions at the same time and involve the raising of funds predominantly from natural persons, including those that are not high-net worth individuals. This Regulation should apply to crowdfunding services that consist of the joint provision of reception and transmission of client orders and the placement of transferable securities or admitted instruments for crowdfunding purposes without a firm commitment basis on a public platform that provides unrestricted access to investors. The joint provision of those services is the key feature of crowdfunding services compared to certain investment services provided under Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">

               <p>In relation to lending-based crowdfunding, this Regulation should apply to crowdfunding services that consist of the facilitation of granting of loans, including services such as presenting crowdfunding offers to clients and pricing or assessing the credit risk of crowdfunding projects or project owners. The definition of crowdfunding services should accommodate different business models enabling a loan agreement between one or more investors and one or more project owners to be concluded through a crowdfunding platform. Loans included within the scope of this Regulation should be loans with unconditional obligations to repay an agreed amount of money to the investor, whereby lending-based crowdfunding platforms merely facilitate the conclusion by investors and project owner of loan agreements without the crowdfunding service provider at any moment acting as a creditor of the project owner. The facilitation of granting of loans that falls within the scope of this Regulation is to be distinguished from the activity of a credit institution, which grants credits for its own account and takes deposits or other repayable funds from the public.</p>

               <p>Given the risks associated with crowdfunding investments, it is appropriate, in the interest of the effective protection of investors and of the provision of a mechanism of market discipline, to impose a threshold for a total consideration for crowdfunding offers made by a particular project owner. Accordingly, that threshold should be set at EUR 5000000, which is the threshold used by most Member States to exempt offers of securities to the public from the obligation to publish a prospectus in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="6">

               <p>The overlapping regulatory frameworks established under this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, because of a threshold of EUR 5000000, might increase the risk of regulatory arbitrage and have a disruptive effect on access to finance and the development of capital markets in certain Member States. Moreover, to date, only a limited number of Member States have put in place a specific legal framework regulating crowdfunding platforms and services. Taking into account the fact that, in implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, some Member States have set the threshold to exempt offers of securities to the public from the obligation to publish a prospectus at below EUR 5000000 and taking into account the special effort that might be sustained by those Member States in terms of adjusting their national law and ensuring the application of the single threshold under this Regulation, this Regulation should provide for a non-renewable temporary derogation in order to enable those Member States to make that significant effort. That temporary derogation should apply for the shortest possible period of time, in order to cause the least possible disturbance to the functioning of the internal market.</p>

Objective product features in the context of a crowdfunding platform could be pre-defined project criteria such as the economic sector, the instrument used and the interest rate, or the risk category where sufficient information regarding the calculation method is disclosed.

               <p>The requirements concerning safekeeping of assets are crucial for the protection of investors receiving crowdfunding services. Transferable securities or admitted instruments for crowdfunding purposes which can be registered in a financial instruments account or which can be physically delivered to the custodian should be safe-kept by a qualified custodian, which is authorised in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU or 2014/65/EU. Depending on the type of assets to be safe-kept, assets are either to be held in custody, as with transferable securities which can be registered in a financial instruments account or which can be physically delivered, or to be subject to ownership verification and record-keeping. Safekeeping of transferable securities or admitted instruments for crowdfunding purposes that in accordance with national law are only registered with the project owner or its agent, such as investments in non-listed companies, or are held on an individually segregated account that a client could open directly with a central securities depository, is considered equivalent to asset safekeeping by qualified custodians.</p>

                     <p>Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (OJ L 337, 23.12.2015, p. 35).</p>
                  </authorialNote>, an authorisation to provide crowdfunding services does not equate to an authorisation also to provide payment services. It is therefore appropriate to clarify that, where a crowdfunding service provider provides such payment services in connection with its crowdfunding services, it also needs to be a payment service provider as defined in Directive (EU) 2015/2366. That requirement is without prejudice to entities authorised under Directive 2014/65/EU that carry out an activity referred to in Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 and that are also subject to the notification requirement set out in Article 37 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366. In order to enable proper supervision of such activities, the crowdfunding service provider should inform the competent authorities whether it intends to provide payment services itself with the appropriate authorisation or whether such services will be outsourced to an authorised third party.</p>

Safeguards should therefore be provided when setting out the conditions for authorisation of crowdfunding service providers and for assessing the good repute of the natural persons responsible for their management as well as by restricting the provision of payment services to licensed entities subject to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing requirements. With a view to further ensuring market integrity by preventing risks of money laundering and terrorist financing, and taking into account the amount of funds that can be raised by a crowdfunding offer in accordance with this Regulation, the Commission should assess the necessity and proportionality of subjecting crowdfunding service providers to obligations to comply with national law implementing Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="8">

               <p>To ensure adequate investor protection of different categories of investors participating in crowdfunding projects while facilitating investment flows, this Regulation distinguishes between sophisticated and non-sophisticated investors, and introduces different levels of investor protection safeguards appropriate for each of those categories. The distinction between sophisticated and non-sophisticated investors should build on the distinction between professional clients and retail clients established in Directive 2014/65/EU.
