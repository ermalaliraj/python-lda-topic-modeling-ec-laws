More specifically, the terms &apos;bi-fuel&apos;, and &apos;dual-fuel&apos; have been translated with one and the same term, even though those terms denote different engine operation modes. &apos;Dual-fuel&apos; engines in fact use diesel fuel and gaseous fuel simultaneously, whereas &apos;bi-fuel&apos; engines use the fuels alternately.</p>
