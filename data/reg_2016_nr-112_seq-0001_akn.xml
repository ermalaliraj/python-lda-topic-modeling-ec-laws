Where requirements constitute terms and conditions for connection to national networks, Article 37(6) of the same Directive requires regulatory authorities to be responsible for fixing or approving at least the methodologies used to calculate or establish them. In order to provide system security within the interconnected transmission system, it is essential to establish a common understanding of the requirements applicable to power-generating modules. Those requirements that contribute to maintaining, preserving and restoring system security in order to facilitate proper functioning of the internal electricity market within and between synchronous areas, and to achieve cost efficiencies, should be regarded as cross-border network issues and market integration issues.</p>

               <p>System security depends partly on the technical capabilities of power-generating modules. Therefore regular coordination at the level of the transmission and distribution networks and adequate performance of the equipment connected to the transmission and distribution networks with sufficient robustness to cope with disturbances and to help to prevent any major disruption or to facilitate restoration of the system after a collapse are fundamental prerequisites.</p>

               <p>Secure system operation is only possible if there is close cooperation between power-generating facility owners and system operators. In particular, the functioning of the system under abnormal operating conditions depends on the response of power-generating modules to deviations from the reference 1 per unit (pu) values of voltage and nominal frequency. In the context of system security, the networks and the power-generating modules should be considered as one entity from a system engineering point of view, given that those parts are interdependent. Therefore, as a prerequisite for grid connection, relevant technical requirements should be set for power-generating modules.</p>

               <p>The significance of power-generating modules should be based on their size and their effect on the overall system. Synchronous machines should be classed on the machine size and include all the components of a generating facility that normally run indivisibly, such as separate alternators driven by the separate gas and steam turbines of a single combined-cycle gas turbine installation. For a facility including several such combined-cycle gas turbine installations, each should be assessed on its size, and not on the whole capacity of the facility. Non-synchronously connected power-generating units, where they are collected together to form an economic unit and where they have a single connection point should be assessed on their aggregated capacity.</p>

Transmission system operators (&apos;TSOs&apos;) and distribution system operators (&apos;DSOs&apos;) including closed distribution system operators (&apos;CDSOs&apos;) can take those differences into account when defining the requirements in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, whilst recognising that the thresholds which determine whether a system is a transmission system or a distribution system are established at the national level.</p>

               <p>The reactive power capability needs depend on several factors including the degree of network meshing and the ratio of in-feed and consumption, which should be taken into account when establishing reactive power requirements. When regional system characteristics vary within a systems operator&apos;s area of responsibility, more than one profile could be appropriate. Reactive power production, known as lagging, at high voltages and reactive power consumption, known as leading, at low voltages might not be necessary. Reactive power requirements could put constraints on the design and operation of power-generating facilities. Therefore it is important that the capabilities actually required for efficient system operation be thoroughly assessed.</p>

                              <p>with regard to reactive power capability, the relevant system operator may specify supplementary reactive power to be provided if the connection point of a synchronous power-generating module is neither located at the high-voltage terminals of the step-up transformer to the voltage level of the connection point nor at the alternator terminals, if no step-up transformer exists. This supplementary reactive power shall compensate the reactive power demand of the high-voltage line or cable between the high-voltage terminals of the step-up transformer of the synchronous power-generating module or its alternator terminals, if no step-up transformer exists, and the connection point and shall be provided by the responsible owner of that line or cable;</p>

This supplementary reactive power shall compensate the reactive power demand of the high-voltage line or cable between the high-voltage terminals of the step-up transformer of the power park module or its convertor terminals, if no step-up transformer exists, and the connection point and shall be provided by the responsible owner of that line or cable.</p>

                        <p>In addition to the compliance tests for type B synchronous power-generating modules described in Article 44, power-generating facility owners shall undertake the compliance tests set out in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 6 of this Article in relation to type C synchronous power-generating modules. Where a power-generating module provides black start capability, power-generating facility owners shall also undertake the tests referred to in paragraph 5. Instead of the relevant test, the power-generating facility owner may use equipment certificates issued by an authorised certifier to demonstrate compliance with the relevant requirement. In that case, the equipment certificates shall be provided to the relevant system operator.</p>

                     <p>Each regulatory authority shall specify, after consulting relevant system operators and power-generating facility owners and other stakeholders whom it deems affected by this Regulation, the criteria for granting derogations pursuant to Articles 62 and 63. It shall publish those criteria on its website and notify them to the Commission within nine months of the entry into force of this Regulation. The Commission may require a regulatory authority to amend the criteria if it considers that they are not in line with this Regulation. This possibility to review and amend the criteria for granting derogations shall not affect the derogations already granted which shall continue to apply until the scheduled expiry date as detailed in the decision granting the exemption.</p>
