               <p>This Regulation aims to ensure that in the area of dual-use items, the Union and its Member States fully take into account all relevant considerations. Relevant considerations include international obligations and commitments, obligations under relevant sanctions, considerations of national foreign and security policy including those contained in the Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">

                  </authorialNote>, among them human rights, and considerations about intended end-use and the risk of diversion. Through this Regulation, the Union demonstrates its commitment to maintaining robust legal requirements with regard to dual-use items, as well as to strengthening the exchange of relevant information and greater transparency. With regard to cyber-surveillance items, the competent authorities of the Member States should consider in particular the risk of them being used in connection with internal repression or the commission of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.</p>

               <p>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004), adopted on 28 April 2004, decided that all States are to take and enforce effective measures to establish domestic controls to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their means of delivery, including by establishing appropriate controls over related materials, equipment and technology. Controls are also required under relevant international agreements, such as the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (the &apos;Chemical Weapons Convention&apos; or &apos;CWC&apos;) and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and On Their Destruction (the &apos;Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention&apos; or &apos;BWC&apos;), and in line with commitments agreed upon in multilateral export control regimes.</p>

               <p>The contribution of exporters, brokers, providers of technical assistance or other relevant stakeholders to the overall aim of trade controls is crucial. In order for them to be able to act in conformity with this Regulation, the assessment of risks related to transactions concerned by this Regulation is to be carried out through transaction-screening measures, also known as the due diligence principle, as a part of an Internal Compliance Programme (ICP). In that regard, in particular the size and organisational structure of exporters have to be taken into account when developing and implementing ICPs.</p>

               <p>In order to address the risk that certain non-listed cyber-surveillance items exported from the customs territory of the Union might be misused by persons complicit in or responsible for directing or committing serious violations of human rights or international humanitarian law, it is appropriate to place the export of such items under control. Associated risks relate, in particular, to cases where cyber-surveillance items are specially designed to enable intrusion or deep packet inspection into information and telecommunications systems in order to conduct covert surveillance of natural persons by monitoring, extracting, collecting or analysing data, including biometrics data, from those systems. Items used for purely commercial applications such as billing, marketing, quality services, user satisfaction or network security are generally considered not to entail such risks.</p>

               <p>With a view to strengthening the effective control of exports of non-listed cyber-surveillance items, it is essential to further harmonise the application of catch-all controls in that area. To that end, Member States are committed to supporting such controls by sharing information amongst themselves and with the Commission, in particular regarding technological developments of cyber-surveillance items, and by exercising vigilance in the application of such controls to promote an exchange at Union level.</p>

               <p>In order to enable the Union to react rapidly to the serious misuse of existing technologies or to new risks associated with emerging technologies, a mechanism should be introduced to enable Member States to coordinate their responses when a new risk is identified. Such coordination should be followed by initiatives to introduce equivalent controls at the multilateral level in order to broaden the response to the identified risk.</p>

               <p>Various categories of persons can be involved in the export of dual-use items, including natural persons such as service providers, researchers, consultants and persons transmitting dual-use items electronically. It is essential that all such persons are aware of the risks associated with the export and the provision of technical assistance regarding sensitive items. In particular, academic and research institutions face distinct challenges in export control due to, inter alia, their general commitment to the free exchange of ideas, the fact that their research work often involves cutting edge technologies, their organisational structures and the international nature of their scientific exchanges. Member States and the Commission should, where necessary, raise awareness among the academic and research community and provide them with tailored guidance to address those distinct challenges. In alignment with multilateral export control regimes, the implementation of controls should provide, to the extent possible, for a common approach with respect to certain provisions, in particular regarding the academia related de-control notes &apos;basic scientific research&apos; and &apos;public domain&apos;.</p>

               <p>The Lisbon Treaty clarifies that the provision of technical assistance involving a cross-border movement falls under Union competence.

               <p>Licensing conditions and requirements should be harmonised, where appropriate, in order to avoid distortions of competition and to ensure the consistent and effective application of controls throughout the customs territory of the Union. To that effect, it is also necessary that the competent authorities of the Member States are clearly identified in all control situations. The responsibility for deciding on individual, global or national general export authorisations, on authorisations for the provision of brokering services and technical assistance, on transits of non-Union dual-use items and on authorisations for the transfer within the customs territory of the Union of dual-use items listed in Annex IV, lies with national authorities.</p>

               <p>Guidelines for Internal Compliance Programmes should be introduced in order to contribute to achieving the level-playing field between exporters and to enhance the effective application of controls. Such guidelines should take into account the differences in sizes, resources, fields of activity and other features and conditions of exporters and their subsidiaries, such as intra-group compliance structures and standards, thereby avoiding a &apos;one model for all&apos; approach and helping each exporter to find its own solutions for compliance and competitiveness. Exporters using global export authorisations should implement an ICP unless the competent authority considers it unnecessary due to other circumstances it has taken into account when processing the application for a global export authorisation submitted by the exporter.</p>

Decisions to update the common list of dual-use items subject to export controls set out in Annex I should be in conformity with the obligations and commitments that Member States or the Union have accepted as members of the relevant international non-proliferation agreements and as members of multilateral export control regimes or by ratification of relevant international treaties. Where the amendment of Annex I concerns dual-use items which are also listed in Annex II or IV, those Annexes should be amended accordingly. Decisions to update the common lists of items and destinations set out in Sections A to H of Annex II should be made having regard to the assessment criteria set out in this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">

               <p>Export controls contribute to international security and have an impact on trade with third countries. It is therefore appropriate to develop dialogue and cooperation with third countries in order to support a global level-playing field and enhance international security. In particular, Member States and the Commission should enhance their contribution to the activities of multilateral export control regimes. Member States and the Commission should also support those regimes in developing robust export controls as a global basis and model for international best practice, and an important tool for ensuring international peace and stability. Contributions should be made when a new risk has been identified by all Member States in the field of cyber-surveillance items in order to ensure a multilateral level playing field.</p>
