               <p>Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">
                     <p>Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote> requires standardised OTC derivatives contracts to be cleared through a central counterparty (CCP) in line with similar requirements in other G20 countries. That Regulation also introduced strict prudential, organisational and business conduct requirements for CCPs and established arrangements for their prudential supervision in order to minimise risks to users of CCPs and underpin financial stability.</p>

               <p>Since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the volume of CCP activity in the Union and globally has grown rapidly in scale and in scope. The expansion in CCP activity is set to continue in the coming years with the introduction of additional clearing obligations and the rise in voluntary clearing by counterparties not subject to a clearing obligation. Regulation (EU) 2019/834 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">
                     <p>Regulation (EU) 2019/834 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 as regards the clearing obligation, the suspension of the clearing obligation, the reporting requirements, the risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivatives contracts not cleared by a central counterparty, the registration and supervision of trade repositories and the requirements for trade repositories (OJ L 141, 28.5.2019, p. 42).</p>
                  </authorialNote> amends Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in a targeted manner, improves its effectiveness and proportionality, creates further incentives for CCPs to offer central clearing of derivatives to counterparties, and facilitates access to clearing for small financial and non-financial counterparties. Deeper and more integrated capital markets resulting from the Capital Markets Union (CMU) will further increase the need for cross-border clearing in the Union, thus further increasing the importance and the interconnectedness of CCPs within the financial system.</p>

               <p>The number of CCPs currently established in the Union and authorised under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 remains relatively limited, standing at 16 in August 2019. 33 third-country CCPs have been recognised by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) under that Regulation, allowing them to offer their services to clearing members and trading venues established in the Union. Clearing markets are well integrated across the Union but highly concentrated in certain asset classes and highly interconnected. The concentration of risk makes the failure of a CCP a low-probability but a potentially extremely high-impact event. In line with the G20 consensus, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on recovery and resolution of CCPs in November 2016 to ensure that authorities are appropriately prepared to address a failing CCP, safeguarding financial stability and limiting taxpayer costs.</p>

               <p>Notwithstanding that legislative proposal and in light of the growing size, complexity and cross-border dimension of clearing in the Union and globally, the supervisory arrangements for Union and third-country CCPs should be revisited. By addressing identified problems at an early stage and establishing clear and coherent supervisory arrangements both for Union and third-country CCPs, the overall stability of the Union financial system would be reinforced and the potential risk of a CCP failure should be lowered even further.</p>

               <p>In light of those considerations, the Commission adopted a Communication on 4 May 2017 on responding to challenges for critical financial market infrastructures and further developing the CMU, stating that further changes to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 are necessary to improve the current framework that ensures financial stability and supports the further development and deepening of the CMU.</p>

               <p>The supervisory arrangements under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 rely mainly on the home-country authority. CCPs established in the Union are currently authorised and supervised by competent authorities of the Member States in cooperation with colleges comprising of national supervisors, ESMA, relevant members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), and other relevant authorities. The colleges rely on coordination and information sharing by the CCP&apos;s competent authority which bears the responsibility of enforcing the provisions laid out in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. Diverging supervisory practices for CCPs across the Union can create risks of regulatory and supervisory arbitrage, jeopardising financial stability and resulting in unhealthy competition. The Commission has drawn attention to those emerging risks and the need for greater supervisory convergence in its Communication on CMU of 14 September 2016 and in the public consultation on the operations of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). Within the already existing general remit of ESMA to fulfil a coordination role between competent authorities and across colleges with a view to building a common supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices, ensuring uniform procedures and consistent approaches, and strengthening consistency in supervisory outcomes, ESMA should in particular focus on supervisory areas which have a cross-border dimension or a possible cross-border impact. ESMA should determine the supervisory areas which have a cross-border dimension or a possible cross-border impact based on its expertise and experience in the application of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.</p>

               <p>In view of the global nature of financial markets and of the need to address inconsistencies in the supervision of Union and third-country CCPs, ESMA&apos;s ability to promote convergence in the supervision of CCPs should be enhanced. For that purpose, a permanent internal committee for CCPs (&apos;CCP Supervisory Committee&apos;) should be created to handle tasks related to CCPs authorised within the Union and third-country CCPs. The establishment, the functions and composition of the CCP Supervisory Committee set up within ESMA should be a unique solution to bring together expertise in the field of CCP supervision and should not constitute a precedent for the ESAs.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure a coherent and consistent supervisory approach within the Union, the CCP Supervisory Committee should be responsible for preparing certain specific decisions and carrying out certain tasks which are entrusted to ESMA. Such responsibilities strengthen ESMA&apos;s coordination role between competent authorities and across colleges with a view to building a common supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices, especially with regard to supervisory areas which have a cross-border dimension or a possible cross-border impact. In that respect, such relevant supervisory activities and decisions could include in particular supervisory areas where diverging supervisory practices can create risks of regulatory and supervisory arbitrage or jeopardise financial stability. ESMA should also be informed of all opinions adopted by colleges provided for in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, including the basis of decision-making which the opinion of the college relates to and any recommendations adhered to in those opinions by the college.</p>

               <p>In addition, a mandatory <i>ex ante</i> exchange and discussion regarding draft decisions of competent authorities of CCPs on certain supervisory areas of particular importance should take place within the CCP Supervisory Committee. Moreover, on a voluntary basis and on the initiative of the competent authorities of CCPs, all draft decisions should be able to be subject to an exchange on an <i>ex ante</i> basis. ESMA should not provide an opinion where, as a result of the outcome of the discussion within the CCP Supervisory Committee, no diverging views have been identified. The power for ESMA to provide opinions should ensure that the CCP&apos;s competent authority receives an additional reaction regarding draft decisions by a group of supervisors specialised and experienced in the supervision of CCPs. Such opinions by ESMA should not have any implication for the responsibility of the CCP&apos;s competent authority to take the final decision, which means that the final content of the respective decision would remain at the full discretion of the CCP&apos;s competent authority. Where the competent authority does not agree with an opinion of ESMA, it should provide comments to ESMA on any significant deviation from that opinion. The competent authority should be able to provide comments before, at the same time as, or after adopting a decision. However, where the competent authority provides comments after adopting a decision, it should do so without undue delay. The opinion provided by ESMA should not interfere with the power of colleges to determine the content of their opinion at their own discretion, where applicable.</p>

To facilitate that process, the CCP Supervisory Committee should be able to request that the Board of Supervisors consider the adoption of guidelines, recommendations and opinions by ESMA.

               <p>The functioning of the colleges set up for Union CCPs is crucial for effective supervision of CCPs. In order to ensure Union-wide coherence of the processes within colleges, the written agreements determining the practical arrangements for the functioning of colleges should be refined and more standardised. To further promote the role of the members of colleges, they should be entitled to contribute to the agenda-setting of college meetings. To increase the transparency of colleges, their composition should be public.

That specific separation of responsibilities of the ECB should be acknowledged. Accordingly, where the ECB is a member of a college set up for a Union CCP due to its function as a competent authority of a clearing member within the Single Supervisory Mechanism as well as due to its function as a central bank of issue representing the Eurosystem, the ECB should be vested with two votes in the college.</p>

               <p>The supervisory arrangements in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for third-country CCPs offering clearing services within the Union also require revision. Access to information, the ability to conduct on-site inspections and investigations, the possibility to share information on third-country CCPs between relevant Union and Member States&apos; authorities as well as the possibility to enforce ESMA&apos;s decisions over third-country CCPs need to be improved to avoid important financial stability implications for Union entities. There is also a risk that changes to third-country CCP rules or to a third-country regulatory framework cannot be taken into account and could negatively affect the regulatory or supervisory outcomes leading to an unlevel playing field between Union and third-country CCPs.</p>

It is also necessary to empower ESMA with the monitoring of regulatory and supervisory developments in those third-country CCP regimes that have been deemed equivalent by the Commission. This is in order to ensure that the equivalence criteria and any specific conditions set for their use continue to be satisfied by third countries.

               <p>In view of the growing cross-border dimension of CCPs and of the interlinkages in the Union financial system, it is necessary to improve the ability of the Union to identify, monitor and mitigate the potential risks related to third-country CCPs. The role of ESMA should therefore be enhanced to effectively supervise third-country CCPs that apply for recognition to provide clearing services in the Union. The involvement of the Union central banks of issue in the recognition, supervision, review of recognition and withdrawal of recognition of third-country CCPs that are active in the currency they issue should also be improved. Therefore, Union central banks of issue should be consulted on certain aspects affecting their monetary policy responsibilities in relation to financial instruments denominated in Union currencies which are cleared or to be cleared by CCPs located outside the Union.</p>

               <p>When considering the application of a third-country CCP for recognition, ESMA should assess the degree of systemic risk that the CCP presents to the financial stability of the Union or of one or more of its Member States on the basis of objective and transparent criteria set out in this Regulation. Those criteria should contribute to the overall assessment. Individually, none of those criteria should be considered determinative on its own. Where assessing the risk profile of a third-country CCP, ESMA should consider all risks, including operational risks, such as fraud, criminal activity, IT- and cyber-risk. A Commission delegated act should specify further those criteria. In specifying those criteria, the nature of the transactions cleared by the CCP, including their complexity, price volatility and average maturity, as well as the transparency and liquidity of the markets concerned and the degree to which the CCP&apos;s clearing activities are denominated in euro or other Union currencies should be considered. In that regard, specific features concerning certain agricultural derivative contracts listed and executed on regulated markets in third countries, which relate to markets that largely serve domestic non-financial counterparties in that third country which manage their commercial risks through those contracts, may pose a negligible risk to clearing members and trading venues in the Union as they have a low degree of systemic interconnectedness with the rest of the financial system. Where a framework for the recovery and resolution of CCPs is in force in a third country, that should also be taken into account by ESMA in its analysis of the degree of systemic risk that the applicant CCP established in that third country presents to the financial stability of the Union or of one or more of its Member States.</p>

ESMA should only recognise such a CCP where that CCP complies with those requirements. Those requirements should include certain prudential requirements set out in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 that aim to increase the safety and efficiency of a CCP. ESMA should be directly responsible for ensuring that a systemically important third-country CCP complies with those requirements. Related requirements should also enable ESMA to carry out full and effective supervision of that CCP under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.</p>

Those requirements should relate to the submission of information to the central bank(s) of issue upon its reasoned request, the cooperation of CCPs with the central bank(s) of issue in the context of the assessment of the CCP&apos;s resilience to adverse market developments carried out by ESMA, the opening of an overnight deposit account with the central bank(s) of issue and requirements in exceptional situations that the central bank(s) of issue considers necessary.

               <p>As regards requirements that central bank(s) of issue might be able to impose in exceptional situations, the transmission of monetary policy or the smooth operation of payment systems might be affected by developments in centrally cleared markets in situations such as stresses in the markets (especially the money and repurchase markets) on which the CCP relies to obtain liquidity, situations where CCPs&apos; operations contribute to the drying up of liquidity in the market, or serious malfunctions of payment or settlement arrangements that impede the CCP&apos;s ability to meet its payment obligations or increase its liquidity needs. The determination of the existence of such exceptional situations depends solely on monetary policy considerations and need not coincide with any emergency situation relating to the CCP.

Non-compliance with such temporary requirements might trigger the withdrawal by ESMA of the recognition of the Tier 2 CCP. Those requirements could include, in particular, temporary enhancements to the liquidity risk management of a Tier 2 CCP, such as increase in liquidity buffer, increase in the frequency of the collection of intraday margins, and limits to cross-currency exposures, or specific arrangements for depositing cash and settling payments in the currency of the central bank. The requirements should not extend to other areas of prudential supervision or amount automatically to withdrawal of recognition. Furthermore, the application of those requirements should only be a condition for recognition for a limited period of time of up to six months with a potential extension once to an additional period not exceeding six months. After expiration of this additional period, the application of those requirements should cease to be a condition for the recognition of a Tier 2 CCP. Nevertheless, in the context of a new or different exceptional situation, central banks of issue should not be prevented from imposing temporary requirements, the application of which would be a condition for the recognition of a Tier 2 CCP under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure the effective application of the rules laid down in this Regulation in relation to third-country CCPs, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the further specification of the type of fees, the matters for which fees are due, the amount of the fees to be paid and the manner in which they are to be paid; the further specification of the criteria determining whether a third-country CCP is systemically important or is likely to become systemically important for the financial stability of the Union or of one or more of its Member States; the further specification of the criteria to be used in its equivalence assessments of third countries; the specification of how and under what conditions certain requirements shall be complied with by third-country CCPs; the further specification of rules of procedure relating to the imposition of fines or periodic penalty payments, including provisions on the rights of defence, time limits, the collection of fines or periodic penalty payments and the limitation periods for the imposition and enforcement of penalty payments or fines; and measures to amend Annex IV in order to take account of developments in the financial markets. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="8">

In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States&apos; experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, and in particular with regard to the recognition of third-country CCPs and the equivalence of legal frameworks of third countries, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.

               <p>To ensure consistent harmonisation of rules and supervisory practice on extension of activities and services, colleges and review of models, stress testing and back testing, the Commission should be empowered to adopt regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA with regard to the following: the conditions under which additional services or activities to which a CCP wishes to extend its business are not covered by the initial authorisation; the conditions under which Union currencies are to be considered the most relevant for the purpose of central banks of issue membership in colleges and the details of the practical arrangements for the functioning of colleges; and the conditions under which changes to the models and parameters of CCPs are significant. The Commission should adopt those regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.</p>

               <p>Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely, to increase the safety and efficiency of CCPs by laying down uniform requirements for their activities, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.</p>

Upon conclusion of the period for consultation, the central bank of issue shall duly consider the amendments proposed in the opinions of ESMA or the central banks of issue referred to in point (f) of paragraph 3.</p>
