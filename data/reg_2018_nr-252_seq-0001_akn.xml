               <p>The Communication from the Commission of 19 April 2016 entitled &apos;European Cloud Initiative &#45; building a competitive data and knowledge economy in Europe&apos; calls for the establishment of a European data infrastructure based on leading-class High Performance Computing capabilities and the development of a full European High Performance Computing ecosystem capable of developing new European technology and realise exascale supercomputers. The importance of the area and the challenges faced by the stakeholders in the Union require action in order to gather the necessary resources and capabilities, including the existing ones such as, for example, national supercomputers and supercomputing centres, to close the chain from research and development to the delivery and operation of the exascale High Performance Computing systems. Therefore, a mechanism should be set up at Union level to combine and concentrate the provision of support to the establishment of a world-class European High Performance Computing infrastructure and for research and innovation in High Performance Computing by Member States, the Union and the private sector. This infrastructure should provide access to the public sector users, users from industry, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and users from academia, including the scientific communities of the emerging European Open Science Cloud.</p>

               <p>The Communication from the Commission of 10 May 2017 on the Mid-Term Review on the implementation of the Digital Single Market Strategy &#45; A Connected Digital Single Market for All, identifies High Performance Computing as a critical element for the digitisation of industry and the data economy. Substantial investments are needed to develop, acquire and operate supercomputers that rank among the top three in the world and no single European country has the resources to develop a full High Performance Computing ecosystem alone. There is, therefore, a need for the Member States, the Union and the private sector to coordinate their efforts and share their resources in order to meet the increasing demand for High Performance Computing and to build up a strong and innovative High Performance Computing science and industry ecosystem across the Union. The Communication proposes the creation of a legal instrument that provides a procurement framework for an integrated exascale supercomputing and data infrastructure.</p>

               <p>In order to equip the Union with the computing performance needed to maintain its research at a leading edge, the Member States investment in High Performance Computing should be coordinated and the industrial and market take-up of High Performance Computing technology be reinforced both in the public and private sectors. The Union should increase its effectiveness in turning the technology developments into demand-oriented and application-driven European High Performance Computing systems that are competitive in the marketplace, establishing an effective link between technology supply, co-design with users, and a joint procurement of world-class systems, and creating a globally competitive ecosystem in High Performance Computing technologies and applications. At the same time, the Union should provide an opportunity for its supply industry to leverage on such investments, leading to their uptake in large-scale and emerging application fields such as personalised medicine, connected and automated driving or other lead markets that are underpinned by artificial intelligence, blockchain technologies, edge computing or more broadly by the digitisation of Union industry.</p>

               <p>Horizon 2020 should contribute to the closing of the research and innovation divide within the Union by promoting synergies with the European Structural and Investments Funds (ESIF). Therefore the Joint Undertaking should seek to develop close interactions with the ESIF, which can specifically help to strengthen local, regional and national research and innovation capabilities.</p>

               <p>The Joint Undertaking should provide a favourable framework for Participating States that are Member States to use their ESIF for the acquisition of supercomputers. The use of ESIF in the Joint Undertaking activities is essential for developing in the Union an integrated and networked world-class High Performance Computing and data infrastructure, since the benefits for such infrastructure extend well beyond the users of the Member States. If Participatings States decide to use ESIF for contributing to the acquisition costs of the petascale and the pre-exascale supercomputers, the Joint Undertaking should take into consideration the Union&apos;s share of ESIF of this Participating State, while accounting only the national ESIF share as national contribution to the budget of the Joint Undertaking. In any case, the Union&apos;s contribution from Horizon 2020 and CEF funds should cover up to 50 % of the acquisition costs plus up to 50 % of the operating costs of the pre-exascale supercomputers, to align with the Joint Undertaking&apos;s objective to contribute to the pooling of resources for equipping the Union with world-class pre-exascale supercomputers. In the case of petascale supercomputers, the Union&apos;s contribution from Horizon 2020 and CEF funds would cover up to 35 % of the acquisition costs of the supercomputer, to align with the existing funding for innovation procurement in Horizon 2020. The remaining costs of the petascale supercomputers and the pre-exascale supercomputers should be covered by the Participating States.</p>

               <p>The Joint Undertaking should be the owner of the pre-exascale supercomputers it has acquired. The operation of each pre-exascale supercomputer should be entrusted to a hosting entity. The hosting entity may represent a single Participating State that is a Member State or a hosting consortium. The hosting entity should be in position to provide an accurate estimate and to verify the operating costs of the supercomputer, by ensuring, for example, the functional separation, and to the extent possible, the physical separation of the Joint Undertaking pre-exascale supercomputers and any national or regional computing systems it operates. The hosting entity should be selected by the Governing Board of the Joint Undertaking (&apos;Governing Board&apos;) following a call for expression of interest evaluated by independent experts. Once a hosting entity is selected, the Participating State where the hosting entity is established or the hosting Consortium should be able to decide to call for other Participating States to join and contribute to the funding of the pre-exascale supercomputer to be installed in the selected hosting entity. The share of the Union&apos;s access time to the pre-exascale supercomputer should be directly proportional to the financial contribution of the Union made from Horizon 2020 and CEF funds to the total cost of ownership of that supercomputer and should not exceed 50 % of the total access time of that supercomputer. The contributions of the Participating States in a hosting Consortium to the pre-exascale supercomputer should be translated into shares of access time to that supercomputer. The Participating States should agree among themselves the distribution of their share of access time to the pre-exascale supercomputer. The Joint Undertaking should remain the owner of the pre-exascale supercomputers until they are depreciated. Then ownership could be transferred to the hosting entity for decommissioning, disposal or any other use. If it is so agreed, where the ownership is transferred to the hosting entity before the full depreciation period of a pre-exascale supercomputer or because the Joint Undertaking is being wound up, the hosting entity should reimburse the Joint Undertaking the residual value of the supercomputer.</p>

               <p>The Joint Undertaking should jointly with Participating States procure the petascale supercomputers. The operation of each petascale supercomputer should be entrusted to a hosting entity. The hosting entity may represent a single Participating State that is a Member State or a hosting consortium of Participating States. The Joint Undertaking should own the part that corresponds to the Union&apos;s share of financial contribution to the acquisition costs from Horizon 2020 and CEF funds. The hosting entity should be selected by the Governing Board following a call for expression of interest evaluated by independent experts. The share of the Union&apos;s access time to each petascale supercomputer should be directly proportional to the financial contribution of the Union from Horizon 2020 and CEF funds to the acquisition costs of that petascale supercomputer. The Joint Undertaking should transfer its ownership to the hosting entity after the full depreciation of operation of the petascale supercomputer or when it is being wound up. In the latter case, the hosting entity should reimburse the Joint Undertaking the residual value of the supercomputer.</p>

               <p>The use of the pre-exascale and petascale supercomputers should be primarily for public research and innovation purposes, for any user from academia, industry or the public sector. User allocation of access time to the supercomputers should primarily be based on open calls for expression of interest launched by the Joint Undertaking and evaluated by independent experts. Upon decision by the Governing Board, it should be possible to grant a small percentage of access time without a call for expression of interest in some exceptional cases such as strategic European initiatives or in emergency and crisis management situations. The Joint Undertaking should be allowed to carry out some limited economic activities for commercial purposes. Access should be granted to users established in the Union or a country associated to Horizon 2020. The access rights should be equitable to any user and allocated in a transparent manner.
