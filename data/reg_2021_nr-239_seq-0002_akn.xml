               <p>For ametoctradin, bixafen, fenazaquin, spinetoram and tefluthrin maximum residue levels (MRLs) were set in Part A of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. For thiencarbazone-methyl no MRLs were set in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, and as this active substance is not included in Annex IV to that Regulation, the default value of 0,01 mg/kg laid down in Article 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 applies.</p>

Based on rotational crops studies and taking into account that the uptake of residues in succeeding crops cannot be fully avoided, specific MRLs reflecting uptake of residues from soil were derived for beetroots, carrots, celeriacs/turnip rooted celeries, horseradishes, Jerusalem artichokes, parsnips, parsley roots/Hamburg roots parsley, radishes, salsifies, swedes/rutabagas, turnips, herbal infusions from roots, sugar beet roots and chicory roots.
