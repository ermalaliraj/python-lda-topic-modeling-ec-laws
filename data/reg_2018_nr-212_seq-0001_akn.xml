               <p>It would not be appropriate to subject all aircraft to common rules. In particular, in light of their limited risk to civil aviation safety, aircraft that are of simple design or operate mainly on a local basis, and those which are home-built or particularly rare or only exist in a small number, should remain under the regulatory control of the Member States, without any obligation under this Regulation on other Member States to recognise such national arrangements. However, in order to facilitate the development of national rules for aircraft falling outside the scope of this Regulation, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (&apos;the Agency&apos;) can adopt guidance material for that purpose.</p>

Therefore, organisations involved in the design of such aircraft should be allowed to apply for a type certificate to the Agency or, if applicable, to make a declaration to the Agency in respect of an aircraft type which is to be put on the market by such organisations.</p>

Such measures should also, in as far as possible, be formulated in a manner which focuses on objectives to be achieved, while allowing different means of achieving those objectives, and should also foster a systemic approach to civil aviation, taking into account interdependencies between safety and other technical domains of aviation regulation, including cyber security. This should contribute to a more cost-efficient achievement of required safety levels and to the stimulation of technical and operational innovation.

               <p>Application of sound safety management principles is essential for continuous improvement of civil aviation safety in the Union, anticipating emerging safety risks, and making best use of limited technical resources. It is therefore necessary to establish a common framework for planning and implementing safety improvement actions. To that end, a European Plan for Aviation Safety and a European Aviation Safety Programme should be drawn up at Union level. Each Member State should also draw up a State Safety Programme in accordance with the requirements contained in Annex 19 to the Chicago Convention. That Programme should be accompanied by a plan describing the actions to be taken by the Member State to mitigate the identified safety risks.</p>

               <p>In accordance with Annex 19 to the Chicago Convention, Member States are to establish an acceptable level of safety performance in relation to the aviation activities under their responsibility. In order to assist the Member States in meeting this requirement in a coordinated manner, the European Plan for Aviation Safety should lay down a level of safety performance for the Union in respect to the different categories of aviation activities. That level of safety performance should not have a binding character but should rather express the ambition of the Union and of the Member States with regard to civil aviation safety.</p>

               <p>The essential requirements applicable to unmanned aircraft and their engines, propellers, parts and non-installed equipment should also cover matters relating to electromagnetic compatibility and the radio spectrum, in order to ensure that they do not cause harmful interference, that they use the radio spectrum effectively and that they support the efficient use of the radio spectrum. However, many types of aviation equipment are not necessarily intended specifically for use in either unmanned aircraft or in manned aircraft but could rather be used in both. Therefore, those requirements relating to electromagnetic compatibility and the radio spectrum should only apply from the moment that, and in as far as, the design of the unmanned aircraft and of their engines, propellers, parts and non-installed equipment are subject to certification in accordance with this Regulation. The reason for this is to ensure that the regime applicable to such aviation equipment is aligned with the regime applicable to other aircraft and their engines, propellers, parts and non-installed equipment in respect of which such certification is also required under this Regulation. In terms of content, in order to ensure consistency, those requirement should be equivalent to those in Directive 2014/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="9">

In such cases, the Agency and the Member State concerned should, at the request of the Commission, establish a temporary technical assistance programme in order to assist the Member State concerned in resolving the identified deficiencies.

When designing the technical assistance programme and during its implementation, the needs and views of the Agency and Member State concerned should be taken into account. However, if the Member State concerned recognises that the programme cannot be successfully implemented as planned, it should inform the Commission, and either reallocate responsibility for the certification, oversight and enforcement tasks to which the deficiencies pertain to the Agency or another Member State, or take other measures to resolve the deficiencies.</p>

Unmanned aircraft and their engines, propellers, parts and non-installed equipment should also be excluded from the scope of those Directives, but only from the moment and in as far as the design of the unmanned aircraft and of their engines, propellers, parts and non-installed equipment are certified by the Agency in accordance with this Regulation, given that under this Regulation they are, in that case, subject to essential requirements relating to electromagnetic compatibility and radio spectrum and that compliance with those requirements is to be assessed and ensured as part of the rules on certification, oversight and enforcement provided by this Regulation. However, the exclusion of any such aviation equipment from the scope of Directives 2014/30/EU and 2014/53/EU should only concern aviation equipment which falls within the scope of this Regulation and which is intended exclusively for airborne use on protected aeronautical frequencies. As a consequence, equipment to control unmanned aircraft remotely, as well as equipment which is intended for airborne use but also for certain other uses, is not excluded from the scope of Directives 2014/30/EU and 2014/53/EU and thus can be subject to the rules of both this Regulation and those Directives.</p>

               <p>Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely establishing and maintaining a high uniform level of civil aviation safety, while ensuring a high uniform level of environmental protection, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the largely transnational nature of aviation and its complexity, but can rather, by reason of their Union-wide scope, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,</p>
