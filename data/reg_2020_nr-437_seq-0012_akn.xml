In addition, only a partial suspension of the CCT duties should be granted in respect of certain products that are currently subject to complete suspensions. The date for the mandatory review of those suspensions should be 31 December 2021, in order for that review to take into account the evolution of the battery sector in the Union.</p>

               <p>It is no longer in the interest of the Union to maintain the suspension of CCT duties for certain products listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013. The suspensions for those products should therefore be deleted. Moreover, according to the communication from the Commission of 13 December 2011 concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas, for practical reasons requests for tariff suspensions or quotas where the amount of uncollected customs duty is estimated to be less than EUR 15000 per year cannot be taken into consideration. The suspensions for products which do not reach that threshold, as indicated by the mandatory review, should therefore be deleted from the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013.</p>

This Regulation should therefore enter into force as a matter of urgency,</p>
