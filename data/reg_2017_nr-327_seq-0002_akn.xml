               <p>In its strategic guidelines adopted in June 2014, the European Council stressed that the Schengen area, allowing people to travel without internal border controls, and the increasing numbers of people travelling to the Union require efficient management of the Union&apos;s common external borders to ensure strong protection. It also stressed that the Union must mobilise all the tools at its disposal to support the Member States in their task and that, to this end, integrated border management of external borders should be modernised in a cost efficient way to ensure smart border management, inter alia, with an entry-exit system and supported by the new agency for large-scale IT systems (eu-LISA).</p>

It is desirable that Member States not yet applying the Schengen <i>acquis</i> in full apply it fully by the start of operations of the EES.

As regards the conditions for the operation of the EES, the EES should be operated at the external borders of the Member States which do not yet apply the Schengen <i>acquis</i> in full but for which the verification in accordance with the applicable Schengen evaluation procedure has already been successfully completed, to which passive access to the Visa Information System (VIS) established by Council Decision 2004/512/EC<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">

The EES should, in particular and when relevant, contribute to the identification of any person who does not fulfil or no longer fulfils the conditions of duration of the authorised stay on the territory of the Member States.

               <p>The EES should consist of a Central System (EES Central System), which operates a computerised central database of biometric and alphanumeric data, a National Uniform Interface in each Member State, a Secure Communication Channel between the EES Central System and the central Visa Information System (VIS Central System) of the VIS, and a secure and encrypted Communication Infrastructure between the EES Central System and the National Uniform Interfaces. Each Member State should connect its national border infrastructures to the National Uniform Interface in a secure manner. In order to enable the generation of statistics and reporting, a data repository should be established at central level. In order to enable third&#45;country nationals to verify at any moment the remaining authorised stay, a web service should be developed. The web service should also enable carriers to verify whether third-country nationals holding a Schengen short-stay visa issued for one or two entries have already used the number of entries authorised by their visa. Relevant stakeholders should be consulted in the development phase of that web service. In establishing the technical specifications for the access of carriers to the web service, the impact on passenger travel and carriers should be limited to the extent possible. For this purpose, appropriate integration with relevant systems should be considered.</p>

               <p>Interoperability should be established between the EES and the VIS by way of a direct communication channel between the VIS Central System and the EES Central System to enable the border authorities using the EES to consult the VIS in order to retrieve visa-related data to create or update entry/exit records or refusal of entry records, to enable the border authorities to verify the validity of the visa and the identity of the visa holder by directly searching the VIS with fingerprints at the borders at which the EES is operated and to enable the border authorities to verify the identity of visa-exempt third&#45;country nationals against the VIS by using fingerprints. Interoperability should also enable the border authorities and visa authorities using the VIS to directly consult the EES from the VIS for the purposes of examining visa applications and of taking decisions relating to those applications, and of enabling visa authorities to update the visa-related data in the EES in the event that a visa is annulled, revoked or extended.

               <p>The EES should record and process alphanumeric data and biometric data primarily for the purposes of improving the management of external borders, preventing irregular immigration and facilitating the management of migration flows. Furthermore, it should also be possible to access personal EES data in order to contribute to the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences only under the conditions laid down in this Regulation. The use of biometrics, despite its impact on the privacy of travellers, is justified for two reasons. First, biometrics are a reliable method of identifying third-country nationals who are present on the territory of the Member States but not in possession of travel documents or any other means of identification, a common situation for irregular migrants. Second, biometrics allow for a more reliable matching of entry and exit data of bona fide travellers. The use of facial images in combination with fingerprint data makes it possible to reduce the total number of fingerprints required to be registered, while enabling the same result in terms of accuracy of the identification.</p>

The fingerprints of visa-holding third-country nationals should be checked against the VIS. The facial image of both visa-exempt and visa holding third-country nationals should be registered in the EES. Fingerprints or facial images should be used as a biometric identifier for verifying the identity of third&#45;country nationals who have been previously registered in the EES, for as long as their individual files have not been deleted. In order to take into account the specificities of each border crossing point and the different kinds of borders, the national authorities should establish for each border crossing point whether the fingerprints or the facial image are to be used as the main biometric identifier for carrying out the required verification.</p>

The conditions of access to the EES for the purposes of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences should be such as to allow the designated authorities of the Member States to tackle the cases of suspects using multiple identities. For this purpose, access to the EES should not be prevented where a hit is obtained during the consultation of a relevant database prior to accessing the EES. For law enforcement purposes and in order to prevent, detect and investigate terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences, a search of the database of the EES should be deemed proportionate if there is an overriding public security concern. Any search must be duly justified and proportionate in the light of the interest invoked.</p>

               <p>The personal data stored in the EES should be kept for no longer than strictly necessary for the purposes for which the data are processed. It is sufficient to keep the data related to third-country nationals who have respected the duration of authorised stay in the EES for a period of three years for border management purposes in order to avoid the need for third&#45;country nationals to re-register in the EES before that period has lapsed. This three-year data retention period will reduce the need for frequent re-registrations and will be beneficial for all travellers as both the average border crossing time and the waiting time at border crossing points will decrease. Even for a traveller entering the territory of the Member States only once, the fact that other travellers already registered in the EES do not have to re-register before the expiry of this three-year data retention period will reduce the waiting time at the border crossing point. This three-year data retention period is also necessary to facilitate and expedite border crossings including by using automated and self-service systems. It is also appropriate to set a three-year data retention period for third-country nationals whose entry for a short stay has been refused.

               <p>It is necessary to keep the personal data of third-country nationals who have respected the duration of authorised stay and of third-country nationals whose entry for a short stay has been refused for a period of three years and to keep the personal data of third&#45;country nationals who have not exited the territory of the Member States within the authorised period of stay for a period of five years, to allow the border guard to conduct the necessary risk analysis required by Regulation (EU) 2016/399 before authorising a traveller to enter the territory of the Member States. The processing of visa applications in consular posts also requires analysing the travel history of the applicant in order to assess the use of previous visas and whether the conditions of stay have been respected. The abandoning of passport stamping is to be compensated by a consultation of the EES. The travel history available in the EES should therefore cover a period of time which is sufficient for the purpose of visa issuance. While conducting risk analyses at the border and while processing visa applications, the travel history of third-country nationals should be checked in order to determine whether they have exceeded the maximum duration of their authorised stay in the past. It is thus necessary to keep the personal data of third-country nationals who have not exited the territory of the Member States within the authorised period of stay for the longer period of five years compared to that for the personal data of third-country nationals who have respected the duration of authorised stay and of third-country nationals whose entry for a short stay has been refused.</p>

In addition, the operation of the EES requires the granting of passive access to the VIS and the putting into effect of all the provisions of the Schengen <i>acquis</i> relating to the SIS in accordance with the relevant Council Decisions. Those conditions can only be met once the verification in accordance with the applicable Schengen evaluation procedure has been successfully completed. Therefore, the EES should be operated only by those Member States which fulfil those conditions by the start of operations of the EES. Member States not operating the EES from the initial start of operations should be connected to the EES in accordance with the procedure set out in this Regulation as soon as all of those conditions are met.</p>

                     <p>Within a period of two years following the start of operations of the EES, the Commission shall produce a report on the quality standards of facial images stored in the VIS and on whether they are such that they enable biometric matching with a view to using facial images stored in the VIS at borders and within the territory of the Member States for the verification of the identity of third-country nationals subject to a visa requirement, without storing such facial images in the EES. The Commission shall transmit that report to the European Parliament and to the Council. That report shall be accompanied, where considered appropriate by the Commission, by legislative proposals, including proposals to amend this Regulation, Regulation (EC) No 767/2008, or both, as regards the use of the facial images of third-country nationals stored in the VIS for the purposes referred to in this paragraph.</p>

To that end, eu-LISA shall establish a Secure Communication Channel between the central system of the EES and the central VIS. Direct consultation between the EES and the VIS shall only be possible if both this Regulation and Regulation 2017/2226 so provide. Retrieval of visa-related data from the VIS, their exportation into the EES and the updating of data from the VIS in the EES shall be an automated process once the operation in question is launched by the authority concerned.</p>
