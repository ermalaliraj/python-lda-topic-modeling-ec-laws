               <p>Titanium dioxide is authorised both as a colorant under entry 143 of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and as a UV-filter under entry 27 of Annex VI to that Regulation. In accordance with point (3) of the Preamble to Annexes II to VI to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, the substances listed in Annexes III to VI to that Regulation do not cover nanomaterials, except where specifically mentioned. Titanium dioxide (nano) is currently not regulated.</p>

               <p>According to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (&apos;SCCS&apos;) of 22 July 2013, which was revised on 22 April 2014<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">
                     <p>SCCS/1516/13 Revision of 22 April 2014, http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_136.pdf</p>
                  </authorialNote>, the use of titanium dioxide (nano) as a UV-filter in sunscreens, with the characteristics as indicated in the opinion, and at a concentration up to 25 % w/w, can be considered to not pose any risk of adverse effects in humans after application on healthy, intact or sunburnt skin. In addition, considering the absence of a systemic exposure, the SCCS considers that the use of titanium dioxide (nano) in dermally applied cosmetic products should not pose any significant risk to the consumer.</p>

            <recital xml:id="rec_d730e102">
               <num>(3)</num>
               <p>The characteristics indicated by the SCCS in its opinion concern the physico-chemical properties of the material (such as purity, structure and physical appearance, particle number size distribution, aspect ratio, volume specific surface area and photocatalytic activity) and whether it is uncoated or coated with specific chemicals. Therefore, these physico-chemical properties and requirements regarding coatings should be reflected in Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009.</p>

               <p>The SCCS also considered that, on the basis of available information, the use of titanium dioxide (nano) in spray products cannot be considered safe. In addition, the SCCS indicated, in a further opinion of 23 September 2014 for clarification of the meaning of the term &apos;sprayable applications/products&apos; for the nano forms of carbon black CI 77266, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">
