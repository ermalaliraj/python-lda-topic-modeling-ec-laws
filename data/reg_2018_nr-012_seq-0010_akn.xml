               <p>For fluazinam, flutriafol and prohexadione, maximum residue levels (MRLs) were set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. For chlorpyrifos-methyl, MRLs were set in Annex II and Part B of Annex III to that Regulation. For ametoctradin, cyproconazole and difenoconazole, MRLs were set in Part A of Annex III to that Regulation. For sodium chloride, no specific MRLs were set nor was that substance included in Annex IV to that Regulation, so the default value of 0,01 mg/kg laid down in Article 18(1)(b) thereof applies.</p>

               <p>As regards all other applications, the Authority concluded that all requirements with respect to data were met and that the modifications to the MRLs requested by the applicants were acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups. It took into account the most recent information on the toxicological properties of the substances. Neither the lifetime exposure to these substances via consumption of all food products that may contain them, nor the short-term exposure due to high consumption of the relevant products showed that there is a risk that the acceptable daily intake or the acute reference dose is exceeded.</p>
