               <p>On 15 April 2014, the Commission adopted a report on the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">
                     <p>Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 (OJ L 338, 23.12.2003, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote>. The report concluded that Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 is a well-functioning instrument that has brought important benefits to citizens, but that the existing rules could be improved. A number of amendments are to be made to that Regulation. In the interests of clarity, that Regulation should be recast.</p>

               <p>This Regulation establishes uniform jurisdiction rules for divorce, legal separation and marriage annulment as well as for disputes about parental responsibility with an international element. It facilitates the circulation of decisions, as well as of authentic instruments and certain agreements, in the Union by laying down provisions on their recognition and enforcement in other Member States. Moreover, this Regulation clarifies the child&apos;s right to be provided with an opportunity to express his or her views in proceedings to which he or she is subject and also contains provisions complementing the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (&apos;the 1980 Hague Convention&apos;) in relations between Member States. Therefore, this Regulation should help to strengthen legal certainty and increase flexibility, to ensure that access to court proceedings is improved and to ensure that such proceedings are made more efficient.</p>

               <p>The smooth and correct functioning of a Union area of justice with respect for the Member States&apos; different legal systems and traditions is vital for the Union. In that regard, mutual trust in one another&apos;s justice systems should be further enhanced. The Union has set itself the objective of creating, maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons and access to justice are ensured. With a view to implementing that objective, the rights of persons, in particular children, in legal procedures should be reinforced in order to facilitate the cooperation of judicial and administrative authorities and the enforcement of decisions in family law matters with cross-border implications. The mutual recognition of decisions in civil matters should be enhanced, access to justice should be simplified and exchanges of information between the authorities of the Member States should be improved.</p>

               <p>To this end, the Union is to adopt, among others, measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications, particularly when necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market. The term &apos;civil matters&apos; should be interpreted autonomously, in accordance with the established case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (&apos;the Court of Justice&apos;). It should be regarded as an independent concept to be interpreted by referring, first, to the objectives and scheme of this Regulation and, second, to the general principles which stem from the corpus of the national legal systems. The term &apos;civil matters&apos; should therefore be interpreted as capable of extending also to measures which, from the point of view of the legal system of a Member State, might fall under public law. It should cover, in particular, all applications, measures or decisions in matters of &apos;parental responsibility&apos; within the meaning of this Regulation, in accordance with its objectives.</p>

               <p>This Regulation covers &apos;civil matters&apos;, which includes civil court proceedings and the resulting decisions as well as authentic instruments and certain extra-judicial agreements in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility. Moreover, the term &apos;civil matters&apos; should cover applications, measures or decisions as well as authentic instruments and certain extra-judicial agreements concerning the return of a child under the 1980 Hague Convention, which, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice and in line with Article 19 of the 1980 Hague Convention, are not proceedings on the substance of parental responsibility but closely related to it and addressed by certain provisions of this Regulation.</p>

In this context, this Regulation should, for instance, apply in cases where the object of the proceedings is the designation of a person or body administering the child&apos;s property. Measures relating to the child&apos;s property which do not concern the protection of the child should continue to be governed by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">

As a result, also &apos;educational placements&apos; ordered by a court or arranged by a competent authority with the agreement of the parents or the child or upon their request following deviant behaviour of the child should be included. Only a placement &#45; be it educational or punitive &#45; ordered or arranged following an act of the child which, if committed by an adult, could amount to a punishable act under national criminal law, regardless of whether in the particular case this could lead to a conviction, should be excluded.</p>

In addition to the courts for the place where the defendant, or the creditor, is habitually resident, the courts having jurisdiction under this Regulation in matrimonial matters should generally have jurisdiction to decide on ancillary spousal or post-marital maintenance obligations by application of point (c) of Article 3 of that Regulation.

               <p>According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, the term &apos;court&apos; should be given a broad meaning so as to also cover administrative authorities, or other authorities, such as notaries, who or which exercise jurisdiction in certain matrimonial matters or matters of parental responsibility. Any agreement approved by the court following an examination of the substance in accordance with national law and procedure should be recognised or enforced as a &apos;decision&apos;. Other agreements which acquire binding legal effect in the Member State of origin following the formal intervention of a public authority or other authority as communicated to the Commission by a Member State for that purpose should be given effect in other Member States in accordance with the specific provisions on authentic instruments and agreements in this Regulation. This Regulation should not allow free circulation of mere private agreements. However, agreements which are neither a decision nor an authentic instrument, but have been registered by a public authority competent to do so, should circulate. Such public authorities might include notaries registering agreements, even where they are exercising a liberal profession.</p>

               <p>Although return proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention are not proceedings on the substance of parental responsibility, decisions ordering the return of a child pursuant to the 1980 Hague Convention should benefit from recognition and enforcement under Chapter IV of this Regulation where they need to be enforced in another Member State due to a further abduction after return was ordered. This is without prejudice to the possibility of starting new proceedings for the return of a child under the 1980 Hague Convention with regard to the further abduction. Moreover, this Regulation should continue to apply to other aspects in situations of wrongful removal or retention of a child, for example the jurisdiction provisions for the court of the Member State of habitual residence, and the recognition and enforcement provisions for any orders made by that court.</p>

This should avoid an overlap with the scope of the Hague Convention of 13 January 2000 on the International Protection of Adults which applies from the age of 18 years onwards and, at the same time, prevent gaps between those two instruments. The 1980 Hague Convention, and consequently also Chapter III of this Regulation, which complements the application of the 1980 Hague Convention in relations between Member States, should continue to apply to children up to the age of 16 years.</p>

Member States which have concentrated jurisdiction should consider enabling the court seised with the return application under the 1980 Hague Convention to exercise also the jurisdiction agreed upon or accepted by the parties pursuant to this Regulation in matters of parental responsibility where agreement of the parties was reached in the course of the return proceedings. Such agreements should include agreements both on the return and the non-return of the child.

According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, anyone other than the parents who, according to national law, has the capacity of a party to the proceedings commenced by the parents, should be considered a party to the proceedings for the purposes of this Regulation and therefore, opposition by that party to the choice of jurisdiction made by the parents of the child in question, after the date on which the court was seised, should preclude the acceptance of prorogation of jurisdiction by all the parties to the proceedings at that date from being established. Before exercising its jurisdiction based on a choice of court agreement or acceptance the court should examine whether this agreement or acceptance was based on an informed and free choice of the parties concerned and not a result of one party taking advantage of the predicament or weak position of the other party. The acceptance of jurisdiction in the course of the proceedings should be recorded by the court in accordance with national law and procedure.</p>

This presence rule should also apply to refugee children and children internationally displaced because of disturbances occurring in their Member State of habitual residence. However, in light of this Regulation in conjunction with Article 52(2) of the 1996 Hague Convention, this jurisdiction rule should only apply to children who had their habitual residence in a Member State before the displacement. Where the habitual residence of the child before the displacement was in a third State, the jurisdiction rule of the 1996 Hague Convention on refugee children and internationally displaced children should apply.</p>

               <p>In exceptional circumstances, a court of the Member State of habitual residence of the child might not be the most appropriate court to deal with the case. As an exception and under certain conditions, while under no obligation to do so, the court having jurisdiction should be able, to transfer its jurisdiction in a specific case to a court of another Member State if this court is better placed to assess the best interests of the child in the particular case. According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, the transfer of jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility, by a court of a Member State, should be made only to a court of another Member State with which the child concerned has a &apos;particular connection&apos;. This Regulation should set out an exhaustive list of the decisive elements of such &apos;particular connection&apos;. The court having jurisdiction should make the request to the court of another Member State only if its prior decision to stay the proceedings and make a request for transfer of jurisdiction has become final where that decision can be appealed under national law.</p>

Those measures should not be recognised and enforced in any other Member State under this Regulation, with the exception of measures taken to protect the child from a grave risk as referred to in point (b) of Article 13(1) of the 1980 Hague Convention. Measures taken to protect the child from such risk should remain in force until a court of the Member State of the habitual residence of the child has taken the measures it considers appropriate. Insofar as the protection of the best interests of the child so requires, the court should inform, directly or through the Central Authorities, the court of the Member State having jurisdiction over the substance of the matter under this Regulation about the measures taken. The failure to provide such information should, however, not as such be a ground for the non-recognition of the measure.</p>

               <p>This Regulation defines at what time a court is deemed to be seised for the purposes of this Regulation. In light of the two different systems existing in the Member States, which either require the document instituting the proceedings to be served upon the respondent first, or to be lodged with the court first, it should be sufficient for the first step under national law to have been taken, provided that the applicant has not subsequently failed to take any steps that he or she was required to take under national law in order to have the second step effected. Taking into account the growing importance of mediation and other methods of alternative dispute resolution, also during court proceedings, in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice, a court should also be deemed to be seised at the time when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court in cases where the proceedings have in the meantime been suspended, with a view to finding an amicable solution, upon application of the party who instituted them, without the document instituting the proceedings having yet been served upon the respondent and without the respondent having had knowledge about the proceedings or having participated in them in any way, provided that the party who instituted the proceedings has not subsequently failed to take any steps that he or she was required to take to have service effected on the respondent. According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, in the case of <i>lis pendens</i>, the date on which a mandatory conciliation procedure was lodged before a national conciliation authority should be considered as the date on which a &apos;court&apos; is deemed to be seised.</p>

               <p>In the interests of the harmonious administration of justice it is necessary to minimise the possibility of concurrent proceedings and to ensure that irreconcilable decisions will not be given in different Member States. There should be a clear and effective mechanism for resolving cases of <i>lis pendens</i> and related actions, and for obviating problems flowing from national differences as to the determination of the time when a case is regarded as pending. For the purposes of this Regulation, that time should be defined autonomously. However, in order to enhance the effectiveness of exclusive choice-of-court agreements, the provisions of this Regulation on <i>lis pendens</i> should not stand in the way where parents confer exclusive jurisdiction on the courts of a Member State.</p>

               <p>Proceedings in matters of parental responsibility under this Regulation as well as return proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention should, as a basic principle, provide the child who is subject to those proceedings and who is capable of forming his or her own views, in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice, with a genuine and effective opportunity to express his or her views and when assessing the best interests of the child, due weight should be given to those views. The opportunity of the child to express his or her views freely in accordance with Article 24(1) of the Charter and in the light of Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child plays an important role in the application of this Regulation. The Regulation should, however, leave the question of who will hear the child and how the child is heard to be determined by national law and procedure of the Member States. Consequently, it should not be the purpose of this Regulation to set out whether the child should be heard by the judge in person or by a specially trained expert reporting to the court afterwards, or whether the child should be heard in the courtroom or in another place or through other means. In addition, while remaining a right of the child, hearing the child cannot constitute an absolute obligation, but must be assessed taking into account the best interests of the child, for example, in cases involving agreements between the parties. Whilst, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, it is not a requirement of Article 24 of the Charter and of Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 that the court of the Member State of origin obtain the views of the child in every case by means of a hearing, and that that court thus retains a degree of discretion, the case-law also provides that, where that court decides to provide the opportunity for the child to be heard, the court is required to take all measures which are appropriate to the arrangement of such a hearing, having regard to the best interests of the child and the circumstances of each individual case, in order to ensure the effectiveness of those provisions, and to offer to the child a genuine and effective opportunity to express his or her views. The court of the Member State of origin should, in so far as possible and always taking into consideration the best interests of the child, use all means available to it under national law as well as the specific instruments of international judicial cooperation, including, when appropriate, those provided for by Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="7">

Jurisdiction for child abduction cases could be concentrated in one single court for the whole country or in a limited number of courts, using, for example, the number of appellate courts as point of departure and concentrating jurisdiction for international child abduction cases upon one court of first instance within each district of a court of appeal.</p>

               <p>In return proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention, the courts at every instance should give their decision within six weeks, except where exceptional circumstances make this impossible. The fact that means of alternative dispute resolution are used should not as such be considered an exceptional circumstance allowing the timeframe to be exceeded. However, exceptional circumstances might arise while using such means or as a result of them. For a court of first instance, the timeframe should start at the moment that the court is seised. For a court of higher instance, it should start at the moment that all required procedural steps have been taken. Such steps could include, depending on the legal system concerned, service of the appeal upon the respondent, either within the Member State where the court is located or within another Member State, transmission of the file and the appeal to the appellate court in Member States where the appeal has to be lodged with the court whose decision is appealed, or an application by a party to convene a hearing where such an application is required under national law. Member States should also consider limiting the number of appeals possible against a decision granting or refusing the return of a child under the 1980 Hague Convention to one.</p>

               <p>In all cases concerning children, and in particular in cases of international child abduction, courts should consider the possibility of achieving solutions through mediation and other appropriate means, assisted, where appropriate, by existing networks and support structures for mediation in cross-border parental responsibility disputes. Such efforts should not, however, unduly prolong the return proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention. Moreover, mediation might not always be appropriate, especially in cases of domestic violence. Where in the course of return proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention, parents reach agreement on the return or non-return of the child, and also on matters of parental responsibility, this Regulation should, under certain circumstances, make it possible for them to agree that the court seised under the 1980 Hague Convention should have jurisdiction to give binding legal effect to their agreement, either by incorporating it into a decision, approving it or by using any other form provided by national law and procedure. Member States which have concentrated jurisdiction should therefore consider enabling the court seised with the return proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention to exercise also the jurisdiction agreed upon or accepted by the parties pursuant to this Regulation in matters of parental responsibility where agreement of the parties was reached in the course of those return proceedings.</p>

               <p>Where a court considers refusing to return a child solely on the basis of point (b) of Article 13(1) of the 1980 Hague Convention, it should not refuse to return the child if either the party seeking the return of the child satisfies the court, or the court is otherwise satisfied, that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return. Examples for such arrangements could include a court order from that Member State prohibiting the applicant to come close to the child, a provisional, including protective measure from that Member State allowing the child to stay with the abducting parent who is the primary carer until a decision on the substance of rights of custody has been made in that Member State following the return, or the demonstration of available medical facilities for a child in need of treatment. Which type of arrangement is adequate in the particular case should depend on the concrete grave risk to which the child is likely to be exposed by the return without such arrangements. The court seeking to establish whether adequate arrangements have been made should primarily rely on the parties and, where necessary and appropriate, request the assistance of Central Authorities or network judges, in particular within the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters, as established by Council Decision 2001/470/EC<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="8">

               <p>As concerns the opportunity given to a child to express his or her views, it should be for the court of origin to decide about the appropriate method for hearing a child. Therefore, it should not be possible to refuse recognition of a decision on the sole ground that the court of origin used a different method to hear the child than a court in the Member State of recognition would use. The Member State where recognition is invoked should not refuse recognition where one of the exceptions from this particular ground for refusal as permitted by this Regulation applies. The effect of those exceptions is that it should not be possible for a court in the Member State of enforcement to refuse to enforce a decision on the sole ground that the child was not given the opportunity to express his or her views, taking into account his or her best interests, if the proceedings only concerned the property of the child and provided that giving such an opportunity was not required in light of the subject matter of the proceedings, or in the case of the existence of serious grounds taking into account, in particular, the urgency of the case. Such serious grounds could be given, for instance, where there is imminent danger for the child&apos;s physical and psychological integrity or life and any further delay might bear the risk that this danger materialises.</p>

               <p>In addition, the aim of making cross-border litigation concerning children less time consuming and costly justifies the abolition of the declaration of enforceability or the registration for enforcement, as applicable, prior to enforcement in the Member State of enforcement for all decisions in matters of parental responsibility. While Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 only abolished this requirement for certain decisions granting rights of access and certain decisions entailing the return of a child, this Regulation should abolish it for the cross-border enforcement of all decisions in matters of parental responsibility while still retaining an even more favourable treatment of certain decisions granting rights of access and certain decisions entailing the return of a child. As a result, subject to this Regulation, a decision given by the court of any other Member State should be treated as if it had been given in the Member State of enforcement.</p>

               <p>Where provisional, including protective, measures are ordered by a court having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter, the circulation of those measures should be ensured under this Regulation. However, provisional, including protective, measures which were ordered by such a court without the defendant being summoned to appear should not be recognised and enforced under this Regulation unless the decision containing the measure is served on the defendant prior to enforcement. This should not preclude the recognition and enforcement of such measures under national law. Where provisional, including protective, measures are ordered by a court of a Member State not having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter, their circulation should be confined, under this Regulation, to measures taken in international child abduction cases and aimed at protecting the child from the grave risk referred to in point (b) of Article 13(1) of the 1980 Hague Convention. Those measures should apply until a court of a Member State having jurisdiction over the substance of the matter under this Regulation has taken the measures it considers appropriate.</p>

It should be for the authority competent for enforcement or the court of the Member State of enforcement to order, take or arrange for specific measures to be taken at the enforcement stage, such as any non-coercive measures which might be available under the national law of that Member State, or any coercive measures which might be available under that law, including fines, imprisonment or the fetching of the child by a bailiff.</p>

However, any such arrangements should not interfere with, or go beyond, the essential elements of the decision on the rights of access. Moreover, the power under this Regulation to adjust measures should not allow the court of enforcement to replace measures that are unknown in the law of the Member State of enforcement, with different measures.</p>

               <p>The enforcement in a Member State of a decision given in another Member State without a declaration of enforceability should not jeopardise the respect for the rights of the defence. Therefore, the person against whom enforcement is sought should be able to apply for refusal of the recognition or enforcement of a decision if he or she considers one of the grounds for refusal of recognition or enforcement of this Regulation to be present. It is for national law to determine whether the grounds for refusal of recognition set out in this Regulation are to be examined <i>ex officio</i> or upon application. Therefore, the same examination should be possible in the context of the refusal of enforcement.

               <p>In matters of parental responsibility, enforcement will always concern a child and in many cases the handover of a child to a person other than the person with whom the child is residing at that time and/or the relocation of the child to another Member State. The primary objective should thus be to strike the right balance between the right of the applicant, as a principle, to obtain implementation of a decision as quickly as possible also in cross-border cases within the Union and, if need be, also by applying coercive measures, and the need to limit, as far as possible, exposure of the child to such possibly traumatising coercive enforcement measures in cases where this cannot be avoided. This assessment should be made by the authorities competent for enforcement and the courts in each Member State in the light of each individual case.</p>

               <p>This Regulation seeks to establish a level playing field as regards the cross-border enforcement of decisions in matters of parental responsibility among Member States. In a number of Member States, these decisions are already enforceable even if they are still subject to appeal, or already under appeal. In other Member States, only a final decision no longer subject to ordinary appeal is enforceable. In order to cater for situations of urgency, this Regulation therefore provides that certain decisions in matters of parental responsibility might be declared provisionally enforceable by the court of the Member State of origin even if still subject to appeal, namely decisions ordering the return of a child under the 1980 Hague Convention and decisions granting rights of access.</p>

               <p>In enforcement procedures concerning children, however, it is important for the authorities competent for enforcement or the courts to be able to react swiftly to a relevant change of circumstances, including challenges against the decision in the Member State of origin, loss of enforceability of the decision and obstacles or emergency situations they encounter at the enforcement stage. Therefore, the enforcement proceedings should be suspended, upon application or of the authority&apos;s or court&apos;s own motion, where the enforceability of the decision is suspended in the Member State of origin. The authority or court competent for enforcement should, however, not be obliged to investigate actively whether in the meantime enforceability has been suspended, following an appeal or otherwise, in the Member State of origin if there is no indication that this is the case. Moreover, the suspension or refusal of enforcement in the Member State of enforcement should be upon application and, even where one or more of the grounds contained in or permitted by this Regulation are found to exist, the suspension or refusal of enforcement in the Member State of enforcement should be left to the discretion of the authority competent for enforcement or the court.</p>

               <p>In exceptional cases, it should be possible for the authority competent for enforcement or the court to suspend the enforcement proceedings if enforcement would expose the child to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm due to temporary impediments which have arisen after the decision was given, or by virtue of any other significant change of circumstances. Enforcement should be resumed as soon as the grave risk of physical or psychological harm ceases to exist. If it continues to exist, however, before refusing enforcement any appropriate steps should be taken in accordance with national law and procedure including, where appropriate, with the assistance of other relevant professionals, such as social workers or child psychologists, to try to ensure implementation of the decision. In particular, the authority competent for enforcement or the court should, in accordance with national law and procedure, try to overcome any impediments created by a change of circumstances, such as, for example, manifest objection of the child voiced only after the decision was given which is so strong that, if disregarded, it would amount to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm for the child.</p>

While this Regulation should provide that a Central Authority, court or competent authority should not disclose or confirm to the applicant or to a third party any information gathered or transmitted for the purposes of this Regulation if it determines that to do so could jeopardise the health, safety or liberty of the child or another person, it should nonetheless underline that that should not impede the gathering and transmitting of information by and between Central Authorities, courts and competent authorities in so far as necessary to carry out the obligations under this Regulation. This means that where possible and appropriate, it should be possible for an application to be processed under this Regulation without the applicant being provided with all information necessary to process it. For example, where national law so provides, a Central Authority might institute proceedings on behalf of an applicant without passing on the information about the child&apos;s whereabouts to the applicant. However, in cases where merely making the request could already jeopardise the health, safety or liberty of the child or another person, there should not be an obligation under this Regulation to make such request.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure that the certificates to be used in conjunction with the application of Chapters III and IV of this Regulation are kept up to date, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to Annexes I to IX to this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="10">
