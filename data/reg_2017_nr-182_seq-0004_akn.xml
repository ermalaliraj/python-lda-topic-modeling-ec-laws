               <p>Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 provides for the rules for approval of combustion plants using animal by-products as a fuel. Its paragraph 8 should be amended accordingly to address the use of manure of any farmed animals as a fuel.</p>

               <p>Manure of farmed animals may present a sustainable source of fuel for combustion, provided the combustion process complies with specific requirements to efficiently reduce adverse effects of its use as a fuel on animal and public health and the environment. Commission Regulation (EU) No 592/2014<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">
                     <p>Commission Regulation (EU) No 592/2014 of 3 June 2014 amending Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 as regards the use of animal by-products and derived products as a fuel in combustion plants (OJ L 165, 4.6.2014, p. 33).</p>
                  </authorialNote> introduced requirements for the use of poultry manure as a fuel in combustion plants. It sets out general requirements for any plant using animal by-products or derived products as fuel and specific requirements for the type of fuel and the type of combustion plant. Manure of farmed animals of species other than poultry may now also be used as a fuel in combustion plants with a total rated thermal input not exceeding 50 MW, under the same conditions as set out for the combustion of poultry manure, including the emission limits and monitoring requirements.</p>

               <p>Operators of combustion plants using manure of farmed animals as fuel should take the necessary hygiene measures to prevent spread of possible pathogens. In this respect, such plants should comply with the general requirements for the use of animal by-products and derived products as a fuel as laid down in Chapter IV of Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 and specific requirements for particular types of plants and fuels that may be used for combustion to be provided for by this Regulation.</p>

               <num>(6)</num>
               <p>The combustion of manure of herbivores, due to its composition, produces higher emissions of particulate matter than the combustion of poultry manure. To address that problem, this Regulation should provide for more flexible emission limit values of particulate matter for very small combustion plants, in order to allow disposal of the manure which could not otherwise be disposed of as fuel for combustion.</p>

            <recital xml:id="rec_d31e130">
               <num>(7)</num>
               <p>Similarly, this Regulation should allow the competent authorities to grant existing combustion plants a transitional period to comply with requirements on controlled temperature rising of the gas, provided that those emissions do not present risks to public and animal health or the environment. The animal by-products legislation does not prevent Member States from applying the relevant calculation rules for emission limit values, set out in the environmental legislation, when manure of farmed animals is combusted together with other fuels or waste.</p>
