               <p>Entry 23 of Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 prohibits the use of cadmium and cadmium compounds in paints with codes [3208] [3209], with a derogation for zinc-based paints. However, this restriction does not apply to the placing on the market of paints containing cadmium.</p>

               <p>In November 2012, the Commission requested the European Chemical Agency (&apos;the Agency&apos;) to prepare an Annex XV dossier with a view to extending the existing restriction to the placing on the market of such paints containing cadmium over a certain concentration.</p>

               <p>On 9 September 2014, the Agency&apos;s Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) adopted by consensus an opinion concluding that such modification of the existing entry would facilitate enforcement and confirming that no additional assessment of the risks presented by cadmium in paints is necessary.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d281e105">
               <num>(4)</num>
               <p>On 25 November 2014, the Agency&apos;s Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis (SEAC) adopted by consensus an opinion indicating that the proposed amendment of the existing restriction is proportionate as it would not impose additional compliance costs on manufacturers, importers or consumers, but would improve the enforceability of the restriction.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d281e114">
               <num>(5)</num>
               <p>It is easier for enforcement authorities to monitor and control placing on the market than use. Moreover the introduction of a concentration limit clarifies that the unintended presence of cadmium in paints as an impurity below that limit will not result in contravention of the restriction.</p>
