               <p>It is incumbent upon the Council to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as appropriate. In accordance with Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, fishing opportunities should be fixed in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) established in Article 2(2) of that Regulation. In accordance with Article 16(1) of that Regulation, fishing opportunities should be allocated to Member States in such a way as to ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each Member State for each fish stock or fishery.</p>

               <p>The landing obligation referred to in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is introduced on a fishery-by-fishery basis. In the region covered by this Regulation, when a fishery falls under the landing obligation, all species in that fishery subject to catch limits should be landed. From 1 January 2016, the landing obligation applies to the species that define the fisheries. Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 provides that, when the landing obligation in respect of a fish stock is introduced, fishing opportunities are to be fixed taking into account the change from fixing fishing opportunities that reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches. On the basis of the joint recommendations submitted by the Member States and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the Commission adopted a number of delegated Regulations laying down specific discard plans applicable on a temporary basis for a maximum period of three years, in preparation for the full implementation of the landing obligation.</p>

               <p>The fishing opportunities for stocks of species falling under the landing obligation from 1 January 2018 should compensate for former discards and be based on scientific information and advice. In order to ensure fair compensation for the fish that has been previously discarded and that will have to be landed from 1 January 2018, a top-up should be calculated according to the following methodology: the new landings figure should be calculated by subtracting from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) figure of total catches the amounts that will continue to be discarded during the operation of the landing obligation; a top-up applied to the TAC figure should be proportional to the change between the new calculated landings figure and the previous ICES landings figure.</p>

               <p>According to scientific advice, European seabass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>) in the Celtic Sea, Channel, Irish Sea and southern North Sea (ICES divisions 4b, 4c and 7a, 7d&#45;7h) remains in a perilous state and the stock continues to decline further, despite the measures taken in previous years. Those measures have not delivered the desired reduction in commercial fishing mortality (only &#45; 17 % instead of the expected &#45; 50 %). Recreational fishing mortality on the Northern stock is now considered to be far more significant than previously calculated and is estimated to have exceeded that from commercial sources in 2016. That also includes post-release sources of mortality. Therefore, the fishing mortality of the Northern stock has to be decreased significantly in order to allow for a small increase in the biomass.</p>

               <p>In order to mitigate the social and economic impact of the above measure, only limited fisheries with certain gears could be permitted, while providing for a two-month closure to protect spawning aggregations. Whilst there could be certain unavoidable by-catches from other fishing gears, the stock status is so severe that it is not possible to allow all by-catches to be landed, and any encounters with the stock should be avoided. Also, there will be a need of further restrictions on recreational fishing, with only catch-and-release fishing allowed during the entire year. Taking into account ICES advice to further reduce fishing pressure on the stock of European seabass in the Bay of Biscay, a lower daily bag limit for recreational fisheries should also be fixed in that area.</p>

               <p>As regards European eel (<i>Anguilla anguilla</i>) stock, the ICES has advised that all anthropogenic mortalities should be reduced to zero, or kept as close to zero as possible. In the light of that advice, it is appropriate to establish a temporary prohibition to fish for European eel of an overall length of 12 cm or longer in Union waters of ICES area including in the Baltic Sea, to protect spawners during their migration.</p>

               <p>For some years, certain TACs for stocks of elasmobranchs (skates, sharks, rays) have been set at zero, with a linked provision establishing an obligation to immediately release accidental catches. The reason for that specific treatment is that the conservation status of those stocks is poor and, because of their high survival rates, discards will not raise fishing mortality rates for them, but are deemed as beneficial for the conservation of those species. As of 1 January 2015, however, catches of those species in pelagic fisheries have to be landed, unless they are covered by any of the derogations from the landing obligation provided for in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Article 15(4)(a) of that Regulation allows such derogations for species in respect of which fishing is prohibited and which are identified as such in a Union legal act adopted in the area of the CFP. Therefore, it is appropriate to prohibit the fishing of those species in the areas concerned.</p>

More recently, the year-to-year flexibility mechanism was introduced by Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 for all stocks that are subject to the landing obligation. Therefore, in order to avoid excessive flexibility that would undermine the principle of rational and responsible exploitation of marine biological resources, hinder the achievement of the objectives of the CFP and deteriorate the biological status of the stocks, it should be established that Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 apply to analytical TACs only where the year-to-year flexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is not used.</p>

The 2018 TAC for Northern albacore for Spain already reflects a deduction of 945,56 tonnes for overfishing which occurred in 2016. That overfishing was compensated at the ICCAT level by fishing opportunities from other Member States (France, Ireland, Portugal and the United Kingdom). An additional payback by Spain will therefore be needed to fully compensate those Member States.</p>

               <p>In 2018, the TAC for Mediterranean swordfish is decreased in line with the ICCAT Recommendation 16-05. As it is already the case for the stock of Eastern and Mediterranean bluefin tuna, it is appropriate that catches in recreational fisheries of all other ICCAT stocks should be subject to the catch limits as adopted by the ICCAT. Furthermore, Union fishing vessels of at least 20 metres length fishing for bigeye tuna in the ICCAT Convention Area should be subject to the capacity limitations adopted by ICCAT in the ICCAT Recommendation 15-01. All those measures should be implemented in the law of the Union.</p>

It also reduced possibilities for using fish-aggregating devices (FADs) and supply vessels. As the activities of supply vessels and the use of FADs are an integral part of the fishing effort exerted by the purse-seine fleet, that measure should be implemented in the law of the Union.</p>

               <p>Certain international measures which create or restrict fishing opportunities for the Union are adopted by the relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) at the end of the year and become applicable before the entry into force of this Regulation. It is therefore necessary for the provisions that implement such measures in the law of the Union to apply retroactively. In particular, since the fishing season in CCAMLR Convention Area runs from 1 December to 30 November, and thus certain fishing opportunities or prohibitions in the CCAMLR Convention Area are laid down for a period of time starting from 1 December 2017, it is appropriate that the relevant provisions of this Regulation apply from that date. Such retroactive application does not prejudice the principle of legitimate expectations as CCAMLR members are forbidden to fish in the CCAMLR Convention Area without authorisation.</p>

               <p>As regards the fishing opportunities for snow crab around the area of Svalbard, the Treaty of Paris of 1920 grants equal and non-discriminatory access to resources for all parties to that Treaty, including with respect to fishing. The Union&apos;s view of that access, as regards fishing for snow crab on the continental shelf around Svalbard, has been set out in two <i>notes verbales</i> to Norway dated 25 October 2016 and 24 February 2017. In order to ensure that the exploitation of snow crab within the area of Svalbard is made consistent with such non-discriminatory management rules as may be set out by Norway, which enjoys sovereignty and jurisdiction in the area within the limits of the said Treaty, it is appropriate to fix the number of vessels that are authorised to conduct such fishery. The allocation of such fishing opportunities among Member States is limited to 2018. It is recalled that in the Union primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with applicable law lies with the flag Member States.</p>
