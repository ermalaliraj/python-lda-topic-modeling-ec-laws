                  </authorialNote> fixes for 2021 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea. On 28 May 2021, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) published a revised scientific catch advice for herring in the Gulf of Bothnia for 2021. The advice updates the catch figure and upgrades the advice to category 1 maximum sustainable yield (MSY) advice. The fishing opportunities for herring in the Gulf of Bothnia should be adjusted accordingly, and therefore Regulation (EU) 2020/1579 should be amended accordingly.</p>

               <p>According to the ICES advice of 13 April 2021, catches of sprat (<i>Sprattus sprattus</i>) in ICES division 3a (Kattegat/Skagerrak) and ICES subarea 4 (North Sea) should be no more than 106715 tonnes for the period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. The fishing opportunities for sprat for that period should therefore be set at 87186 tonnes in Union waters of ICES division 2a and ICES subarea 4, and at 19529 tonnes in ICES division 3a, in line with the maximum sustainable yield.</p>

               <p>Regulation (EU) 2021/92 set at zero the total allowable catch (TAC) for anchovy (<i>Engraulis encrasicolus</i>) in ICES subareas 9 and 10 and Union waters of the Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic 34.1.1 for the period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022, pending the scientific advice for that period. ICES will issue its advice for that stock at the end of June 2021. In order to ensure that fishing activity may continue until the TAC is set on the basis of the latest scientific advice, a provisional TAC of 5744 tonnes, based on the catches in the third quarter of 2020, should be established.</p>

               <p>The numbers in point 6 of Annex VI to Regulation (EU) 2021/92 should be amended in order to reflect agreements concluded between some Member States to temporarily transfer between themselves, exclusively for year 2021, certain amounts of bluefin tuna farming input and capacity. Those changes have been notified to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) through an amended Union farming plan and do not affect the total farming capacity and input capacity of the Union in the ICCAT Convention Area.</p>

               <p>The catch limits provided for in Regulation (EU) 2020/1579 apply from 1 January 2021. The provisions introduced by this amending Regulation concerning catch limits for herring in the Gulf of Bothnia should therefore also apply from that date. Such retroactive application is without prejudice to the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations, as the fishing opportunities concerned have not yet been exhausted.</p>
