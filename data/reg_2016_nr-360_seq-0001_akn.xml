               <p>In order to ensure the sufficient and uninterrupted supply of certain goods insufficiently produced in the Union and to avoid disturbances on the market for certain agricultural and industrial products, autonomous tariff quotas were opened by Council Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="1">
                     <p>Council Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013 of 17 December 2013 opening and providing for the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and industrial products, and repealing Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 319).</p>
                  </authorialNote>. Products within those tariff quotas can be imported into the Union at reduced or zero duty rates. For those reasons, it is necessary to open, with effect from 1 January 2017, tariff quotas at zero duty rates for an appropriate volume as regards eleven new products.</p>

               <num>(2)</num>
               <p>In certain cases, the existing autonomous tariff quotas of the Union should be adapted. In the case of eleven products, the TARIC codes should be changed in view of the classification changes in the Combined Nomenclature set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1821<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">
                     <p>Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1821 of 6 October 2016 amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (OJ L 294, 28.10.2016, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote>. For two products, the product description should be amended for clarification purposes and in order to take into account the most recent product developments. In the case of one product, the quota volumes should be increased in the interests of economic operators of the Union. In two cases, the quota volume should be decreased.</p>

               <num>(3)</num>
               <p>In the case of six products, the autonomous tariff quotas of the Union should be closed with effect from 1 January 2017, as it is not in the Union&apos;s interest to maintain those quotas as from that date.</p>
