For triazoxide no MRLs were set in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 and as this active substance is not included in Annex IV to that Regulation, the default value of 0,01 mg/kg laid down in Article 18(1)(b) of that Regulation applies.</p>

For other products, the Authority recommended raising or keeping the existing MRLs. As there is no risk for consumers, the MRLs for those products should be set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 at the existing level or the level identified by the Authority. It concluded that concerning the MRLs for cucumbers, poultry fat and poultry edible offals (other than liver and kidney) some information was not available and that further consideration by risk managers was required.
