               <p>The goal of a resilient Energy Union with an ambitious climate policy at its core is to give Union consumers, including households and businesses, secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy, and to foster research and innovation by means of attracting investment, which requires a fundamental transformation of Europe&apos;s energy system. Such a transformation is also closely linked to the need to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and to promote the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources, in particular through the promotion of energy efficiency and energy savings and the development of new and renewable forms of energy. That goal can be achieved only through coordinated action, combining both legislative and non-legislative acts at Union, regional, national and local level.</p>

               <p>In its conclusions of 23 and 24 October 2014, the European Council also agreed that a reliable and transparent governance mechanism without any unnecessary administrative burden and with sufficient flexibility for Member States should be developed to help ensure that the Union meets its energy policy goals, while fully respecting Member States&apos; freedom to determine their energy mix. It emphasised that such a governance mechanism should build on existing building blocks, such as national climate programmes, national plans for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the need to streamline and bring together separate planning and reporting strands. It also agreed to step up the role and rights of consumers, transparency and predictability for investors, inter alia by systematic monitoring of key indicators for an affordable, safe, competitive, secure and sustainable energy system and to facilitate coordination of national climate and energy policies and foster regional cooperation between Member States.</p>

The Council underlined that the governance mechanism should be based on the principles of integration of strategic planning and reporting on the implementation of climate and energy policies and coordination between actors responsible for energy and climate policy, at Union, regional and national level. It also underlined that the governance mechanism should ensure that the agreed energy and climate targets for 2030 are met and should monitor the Union&apos;s collective progress towards the achievement of the policy objectives across the five dimensions of the Energy Union.</p>

In its conclusions of 23 and 24 October 2014, the European Council decided that the Commission supported by the Member States will take urgent measures in order to ensure the achievement of a minimum target of 10 % of electricity interconnections, as a matter of urgency, and no later than 2020 at least for Member States which have not yet attained a minimum level of integration in the internal energy market.

               <p>The main objective of the governance mechanism should therefore be to enable the achievement of the objectives of the Energy Union and in particular the targets of the 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy, in the field of GHG emission reduction, energy from renewable sources and energy efficiency. Those objectives and targets stem from the Union policy on energy and from the need to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and to promote the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources, as provided for in the EU Treaties. None of those objectives, which are indissociably linked, can be regarded as secondary to the other. This Regulation is therefore linked to sectoral law implementing the 2030 targets for energy and climate. While Member States need flexibility to choose policies that are best-matched to their national energy mix and preferences, that flexibility should be compatible with further market integration, increased competition, the attainment of climate and energy objectives and the gradual shift towards a sustainable low-carbon economy.</p>

               <p>The achievement of the Energy Union objectives and targets should be ensured through a combination of Union initiatives and coherent national policies set out in integrated national energy and climate plans. Sectoral Union law in the energy and climate fields sets out planning requirements, which have been useful tools to drive change at the national level. Their introduction at different times has led to overlaps and insufficient consideration of synergies and interactions between policy areas, to the detriment of cost-efficiency. Current separate planning, reporting and monitoring in the climate and energy fields should therefore as far as possible be streamlined and integrated.</p>

               <p>The integrated national energy and climate plans should cover ten-year periods and should provide an overview of the current energy system and policy situation. They should set out national objectives for each of the five dimensions of the Energy Union and corresponding policies and measures to meet those objectives and have an analytical basis. The integrated national energy and climate plans covering the first period from 2021 to 2030 should pay particular attention to the 2030 targets for GHG emission reductions, renewable energy, energy efficiency and electricity interconnection. Member States should aim to ensure that the integrated national energy and climate plans are consistent with, and contribute to, achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In their integrated national energy and climate plans, Member States may build upon existing national strategies or plans. For the first draft and final integrated national energy and climate plan, a different deadline is provided as compared to subsequent plans, in order to provide Member States with adequate preparation time for their first plans after the adoption of this Regulation. Nevertheless, Member States are encouraged to provide their first draft integrated national energy and climate plans as early as possible in 2018, in order to allow proper preparation, in particular for the facilitative dialogue to be convened in 2018 in accordance with Decision 1/CP.21 of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>

At the same time, the sector has huge potential to provide for long-term climate benefits and to contribute significantly to the achievement of Union and international long-term climate goals. It can contribute to climate change mitigation in several ways, in particular by reducing emissions, maintaining and enhancing sinks and carbon stocks, and providing bio-materials that can substitute fossil or carbon-intensive materials.

Whereas recommendations have no binding force, as set out in Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Member States should nevertheless take due account of such recommendations and explain in subsequent progress reports how they have done so. With regard to renewable energy, the Commission assessment is to be based on the objective criteria. If the Commission issues a recommendation with regard to a Member State&apos;s draft national plan, it should do so as quickly as possible, having regard, on the one hand, to the need for the Commission to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission&apos;s recommendations before finalising its national plan, and the need to avoid the risk of delay of the Member State&apos;s national plan.</p>

               <p>Cost-effective deployment of renewable energy is one of the key objective criteria for assessing Member States&apos; contributions. The cost structure of deploying renewable energy is complex and varies significantly between Member States. It includes not only the costs of support schemes, but, inter alia, the connection costs of installations, system backup, providing system security and costs that need to be borne when complying with environmental restrictions. Thus, when comparing Member States based on that criterion, all costs related to deployment, whether they are borne by the Member State, final consumers or project developers, should be accounted for. The Commission&apos;s recommendations with regard to the Member States&apos; renewable ambitions should be based on a formula set out in this Regulation which is based on objective criteria. Thus, the assessment of the renewable energy ambition of the Member States should indicate the relative effort made by the Member States, while also taking into consideration relevant circumstances affecting the renewable energy development. The assessment should also include data originating from independent quantitative or qualitative data sources.</p>

               <p>Should the ambition of integrated national energy and climate plans or their updates be insufficient for the collective achievement of the Energy Union objectives and, for the first period, in particular the 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency, the Commission should take measures at Union level in order to ensure the collective achievement of those objectives and targets (thereby closing any &apos;ambition gap&apos;). Should progress made by the Union towards those objectives and targets be insufficient for their delivery, the Commission should, in addition to issuing recommendations, propose measures and exercise its powers at Union level or Member States should take additional measures in order to ensure achievement of these objectives and targets (thereby closing any &apos;delivery gap&apos;). Such measures should also take into account early efforts made by Member States towards the 2030 target for renewable energy by reaching in or before 2020 a share of energy from renewable sources above its national binding target, or by making early progress towards its national binding 2020 target or in the implementation of its contribution to the Union&apos;s binding target of at least 32 % of renewable energy in 2030. In the area of renewable energy, such measures can also include voluntary financial contributions by Member States to a Union renewable energy financing mechanism managed by the Commission, which would be used to contribute to the most cost-efficient renewable energy projects across the Union, thus providing the Member States with the option to contribute to the Union target achievement at the lowest possible cost. Member States&apos; national renewable energy targets for 2020 should serve as baseline shares of renewable energy from 2021 onwards and should be maintained throughout the period. In the area of energy efficiency, additional measures can, in particular, aim to improve the energy efficiency of products, buildings and transport.</p>

This includes, in particular, the treatment of energy efficiency as a crucial element and a key consideration in future investment decisions on energy infrastructure in the Union. Such cost-efficient alternatives include measures to make energy demand and energy supply more efficient, in particular by means of cost-effective end-use energy savings, demand response initiatives and more efficient conversion, transmission and distribution of energy.

               <p>This Regulation should also integrate in full the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013. As a consequence, Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 should be repealed from 1 January 2021. However, in order to ensure that the implementation of Decision No 406/2009/EC continues under Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and that certain aspects linked to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol remain enshrined in law, it is necessary that certain provisions remain applicable after that date.</p>

               <p>Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives,</p>
