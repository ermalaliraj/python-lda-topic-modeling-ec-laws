               <p>For mandipropamid and profoxydim maximum residue levels (MRLs) were set in Part A of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. For 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester no MRLs are set in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, and as this active substance is not included in Annex IV to that Regulation, the default value of 0,01 mg/kg laid down in Article 18(1)(b) of that Regulation applies.</p>

               <p>For 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester, the European Food Safety Authority (&apos;the Authority&apos;) submitted a reasoned opinion on the existing MRLs in accordance with Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">
                     <p>European Food Safety Authority; Review of the existing maximum residue levels for 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. EFSA Journal 2018;16(6):5331.</p>
                  </authorialNote>. The Authority concluded that residues of 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester are not expected to occur in any plant or animal commodities since its unique and restricted use as a pesticide in wine grapes after grafting is not expected to result in significant residues in wine grapes. It is therefore appropriate to set the MRLs at the specific limit of determination. These default values should be set in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.</p>

                  </authorialNote>. The Authority proposed to change the residue definition to mandipropamid (any ratio of constituent isomers). It recommended raising or keeping the existing MRLs. It concluded that concerning the MRLs for potatoes, onions, spring onions/green onions and Welsh onions, tomatoes and courgettes, some information was not available and that further consideration by risk managers was required. As there is no risk for consumers, the MRLs for those products should be set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 at the existing level or the level identified by the Authority. These MRLs will be reviewed; the review will take into account the information available within two years from the publication of this Regulation.</p>

               <p>The Commission consulted the European Union reference laboratories for residues of pesticides as regards the need to adapt certain limits of determination.
