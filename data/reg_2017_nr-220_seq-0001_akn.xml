               <p>To ensure the operational security of the interconnected transmission system, it is essential to define a common set of minimum requirements for Union-wide system operation, for the cross-border cooperation between the TSOs and for utilising the relevant characteristics of the connected DSOs and SGUs.</p>

               <p>All TSOs should comply with the common minimum requirements on procedures necessary to prepare real-time operation, to develop individual and deliver common grid models, to facilitate the efficient and coordinated use of remedial actions which are necessary for real-time operation in order to maintain the operational security, quality and stability of the interconnected transmission system, and to support the efficient functioning of the European internal electricity market and facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources (&apos;RES&apos;).</p>

               <p>While there are currently a number of voluntary regional cooperation initiatives in system operations promoted by TSOs, formalised coordination between TSOs is necessary for operating the Union transmission system in order to address the transformation of the Union electricity market. The rules for system operation provided for in this Regulation require an institutional framework for enhanced coordination between TSOs, including the mandatory participation of TSOs in regional security coordinators (&apos;RSCs&apos;). The common requirements for the establishment of RSCs and for their tasks set out in this Regulation constitute a first step towards further regional coordination and integration of system operation and should facilitate the achievement of the aims of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 and ensure higher security of supply standards in the Union.</p>

               <p>This Regulation should set out a framework for the mandated cooperation of TSOs via the appointment of RSCs. RSCs should issue recommendations to the TSOs of the capacity calculation region for which it is appointed. TSOs should, individually, decide whether to follow or not the recommendations of the RSC. The TSO should remain responsible for maintaining operational security of its control area.</p>

The rules on training and certification strengthen and formalise existing best practices amongst TSOs and ensure that minimum standards are applied by all TSOs in the Union.</p>

               <p>One of the most critical processes in ensuring operational security with a high level of reliability and quality is the load-frequency control (&apos;LFC&apos;). Effective LFC can be made possible only if there is an obligation for the TSOs and the reserve connecting DSOs to cooperate for the operation of the interconnected transmission systems as one entity and for providers&apos; power generating modules and providers&apos; demand facilities to meet the relevant minimum technical requirements.</p>

The provisions on LFC and reserves provide the technical framework necessary for the development of cross-border balancing markets.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure the quality of the common system frequency, it is essential that a common set of minimum requirements and principles for Union-wide LFC and reserves are defined as a basis for both the cross-border cooperation between the TSOs and, where relevant, for utilising characteristics of the connected generation, consumption and distribution systems. To that end, this Regulation addresses the LFC structure and operational rules, the quality criteria and targets, the reserve dimensioning, the reserve exchange, sharing and distribution and the monitoring related to LFC.</p>

                                 <p>all TSOs of that synchronous area shall conduct, not later than 2 years after entry into force of this Regulation, a common study per synchronous area to identify whether the minimum required inertia needs to be established, taking into account the costs and benefits as well as potential alternatives.

The proposal shall respect the methodologies for coordinating operational security analysis developed in accordance with Article 75(1) and complement where necessary the methodologies developed in accordance with Articles 35 and 74 of Regulation (EU) 2015/1222.

In using that probabilistic methodology, the TSOs shall take into account the restrictions defined in the agreements for the sharing or exchange of reserves due to possible violations of operational security and the FRR availability requirements.
