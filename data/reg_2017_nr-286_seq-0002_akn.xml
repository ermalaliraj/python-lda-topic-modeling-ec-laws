               <p>Union legislation on the entry and residence of third-country nationals sets out schemes granting additional mobility rights, with specific conditions for entry and stay in Member States which are bound by that <i>acquis</i>. Residence permits issued in accordance with that legislation use the uniform format laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002. Therefore, in order to enable the competent authorities to identify third-country nationals who may benefit from those specific mobility rights, it is important that those residence permits clearly display the relevant entries, such as &apos;researcher&apos;, &apos;student&apos; or &apos;ICT&apos; in accordance with the relevant Union legislation.</p>
