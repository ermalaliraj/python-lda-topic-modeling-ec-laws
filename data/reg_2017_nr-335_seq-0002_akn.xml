               <p>In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by a Resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015, the importance of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies both as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 and in order to achieve other development policy outcomes was underlined. SDG 16.a specifically requests to &apos;Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacities at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime&apos;.</p>

               <p>Giving support to security sector actors in third countries, including, under exceptional circumstances, the military, in a conflict prevention, crisis management or stabilisation context is essential to ensure appropriate conditions for poverty eradication and development. Good governance, effective democratic control and civilian oversight of the security system, including of the military, as well as compliance with human rights and the rule of law principles are essential attributes of a well-functioning State in any context, and should be promoted through a wider security sector reform support to third countries.</p>

               <p>In line with the EU Comprehensive Approach and in order to maximise the impact, efficiency and consistency of EU support, the Council in its conclusions of 18 May 2015 on CSDP invited the Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to develop, in consultation with Member States, a Union-wide strategic framework to support security sector reform. That policy concept brings together CSDP and all other relevant tools of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) as well as development cooperation instruments, while respecting their respective legal bases, primary objectives and decision-making procedures.</p>

               <p>The Commission is to monitor measures under this Regulation closely. The Commission is to keep the European Parliament duly informed, in a timely manner, about the implementation of Union assistance pursuant to this Regulation. No later than 30 June 2020, the Commission is to evaluate the impact, effectiveness and coherence of measures pursuant to this Regulation with the SDG 16. To that end, the Commission is to associate all relevant stakeholders, including civil society organisations and local authorities, in the evaluation phase ensuring they play a meaningful role in the process. The Commission is to undertake, where appropriate, joint evaluations with Member States. The results are to inform programme design and resource allocation, and to further enhance the consistency and complementarity of the Union&apos;s external action.</p>
