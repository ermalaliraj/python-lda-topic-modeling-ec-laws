               <p>Certain quota transfers or exchanges between the Contracting Parties of a regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO) are agreed at the beginning of the calendar year.

               <p>Given that provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/72 concerning prohibitions of fisheries of vulnerable species or fisheries in periods that should be closed for fishing are to be applied on a continuous basis, and in order to avoid legal uncertainty during the period between the end of 2016 and the date of entry into force of the regulation fixing the fishing opportunities for 2017, it is appropriate to provide that the provisions concerning prohibitions and closed seasons continue to apply at the beginning of 2017, until the entry into force of the regulation fixing the fishing opportunities for 2017.</p>

               <p>Scientific advice by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) supports providing for a small additional commercial quota in order to incite the participation of fishing vessels in a scientific programme on sole in ICES division VIIa, which would be carried out under specific conditions. That additional quota should be granted only for the duration of the scientific programme and would be without prejudice to the relative stability.</p>

               <p>According to the scientific advice by ICES, catches of sprat in the North Sea should be reduced. The fishing opportunities should be established taking into account the fact that a sudden significant in-year decrease in the catch limits would jeopardise the social and economic sustainability of the fleets involved, while at the same time complying with the precautionary approach to fisheries management. It is therefore appropriate to modify the corresponding fishing opportunities table. The amounts allocated for sprat catches in 2016 should be taken into account when fixing the 2017 fishing opportunities for that species.</p>

               <p>ICES provides scientific advice for the species <i>squalus acanthias</i> and the reporting code is also based on the Latin name thereof. However, the common name used in certain language versions of Regulation (EU) 2016/72 does not correspond to the Latin name of the species. The common name should therefore be corrected where necessary.</p>

               <p>The current fishing opportunities for picked dogfish (<i>squalus acanthias</i>) are set at 0 tonnes. A project to introduce real time avoidance of picked dogfish (<i>squalus acanthias</i>) has been evaluated by the STECF. In its evaluation, the STECF identified the potential for the project to promote avoidance of by-catches of picked dogfish (<i>squalus acanthias</i>). The vessels participating in the project should be allowed to land limited quantities of picked dogfish (<i>squalus acanthias</i>) that are either dead or that would not survive even if released immediately. As a precautionary measure to ensure that there is no detriment to the long-term recovery of the stock, those landings should be subject to an overall annual limit of 270 tonnes, with a monthly limit of not more than 2 tonnes for any vessel participating in the project. A list of all participating vessels should be notified by the Member States to the Commission.</p>

               <p>During the inter-sessional meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), in March 2016, it was agreed that the European Union would allocate to Portugal part of its spare farming capacity for inputting of wild caught bluefin tuna for farming. That would allow Portugal to operate a bluefin tuna farm in the future. It is therefore appropriate to establish the maximum input of wild caught bluefin tuna which Portugal may allocate to its farm.</p>
