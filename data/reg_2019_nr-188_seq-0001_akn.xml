               <p>At the 2016 Annual Meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (&apos;ICCAT&apos;) in Vilamoura, Portugal, the ICCAT Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities recognised the need to address the alarming situation of swordfish (<i>Xiphias gladius</i>) in the Mediterranean Sea (&apos;Mediterranean swordfish&apos;), which has been overfished over the last 30 years. To that end, including avoiding the collapse of the stock, and after analysing the scientific advice of the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS), ICCAT adopted Recommendation 16-05 establishing a multiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish (&apos;ICCAT recovery plan&apos;). In view of the fact that the current biology, structure and dynamic of the Mediterranean swordfish stock does not allow the achievement of levels of biomass capable of producing the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in the short term, even if drastic and urgent management measures such as a total closure of the fishery were adopted, the ICCAT recovery plan is to cover the period 2017&#45;2031. ICCAT Recommendation 16-05 entered into force on 12 June 2017 and is binding on the Union.</p>
