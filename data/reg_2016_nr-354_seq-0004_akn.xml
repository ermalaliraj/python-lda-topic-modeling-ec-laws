               <p>With a view to facilitating trade flows, Article 136 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">
                     <p>Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code (OJ L 269, 10.10.2013, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote> excludes the application of certain provisions of that Regulation to goods that have temporarily left the customs territory of the Union while moving between two Union ports or airports without stopping outside the customs territory of the Union. Those provisions govern the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration, the obligation to notify the arrival of a sea-going vessel or an aircraft, the obligation to convey the goods to certain places and to present them to customs at the point where they are unloaded or transhipped, and temporary storage.</p>

            <recital xml:id="rec_d313e94">
               <num>(2)</num>
               <p>As a consequence of that exclusion, there is no legal basis for requiring goods that are unloaded or transhipped to be presented at the point where they re-enter the customs territory of the Union after having temporarily left it. Without such presentation, it may be more difficult for customs authorities to ensure the supervision of the goods concerned, and there is a risk both that import duty and other charges will not be correctly levied and that non-fiscal measures such as veterinary and phytosanitary controls will not be properly applied.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure effective customs supervision of non-Union goods, the provisions governing the obligation to convey the goods to certain places, to present them to customs upon unloading or transhipment, and to wait for authorisation before unloading or transhipping, as well as the provisions governing temporary storage, should continue to apply to non-Union goods. Article 136 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 should therefore be amended to provide that only the rules governing the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration and the obligation to notify the arrival of a sea-going vessel or an aircraft are excluded with regard to non-Union goods.</p>
