               <p>Following an application from Vifor Ltd, submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to Equazen eye q<sup>®</sup> and improving reading ability (Question No EFSA-Q-2014- 00462<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">

               <p>On 13 October 2015, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority, which concluded that a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of Equazen eye q<sup>®</sup>, a combination of EPA, DHA and GLA (at a weight ratio of 9:3:1), and improving reading ability in children. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.</p>
