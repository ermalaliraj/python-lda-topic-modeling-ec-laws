               <p>The Communication of the Commission of 6 April 2016 entitled &apos;Stronger and Smarter Information Systems for Borders and Security&apos; outlined the need for the Union to strengthen and improve its IT systems, data architecture and information exchange in the area of border management, law enforcement and counter-terrorism. It emphasises the need to improve the interoperability of information systems. Importantly, it sets out possible options for maximising the benefits of existing information systems and, if necessary, developing new and complementary ones to address still existing information gaps.</p>

               <p>Indeed, the Communication of 6 April 2016 identified a series of information gaps. Among them are the fact that border authorities at external Schengen borders have no information on travellers exempt from the requirement of being in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders (&apos;the visa requirement&apos;). The Communication of 6 April 2016 announced that the Commission was to launch a study on the feasibility of establishing a European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). The feasibility study was completed in November 2016. The system would determine the eligibility of visa-exempt third-country nationals prior to their travel to the Schengen Area, and whether such travel poses a security, illegal immigration or high epidemic risk.</p>

               <p>The right to obtain a travel authorisation is not unconditional as it can be denied to those family members who represent a risk to public policy, public security or public health pursuant to Directive 2004/38/EC. Against this background, family members can be required to provide their personal data related to their identification and their status only insofar as these are relevant for assessment of the security threat they could represent. Similarly, examination of their travel authorisation applications should be made exclusively against security concerns, and not those related to migration risks.</p>

               <p>ETIAS should provide a travel authorisation for third-country nationals exempt from the visa requirement enabling consideration of whether their presence on the territory of the Member States does not pose or will not pose a security, illegal immigration or a high epidemic risk. A travel authorisation should therefore constitute a decision indicating that there are no factual indications or reasonable grounds to consider that the presence of a person on the territory of the Member States poses such risks. As such, a travel authorisation is by its nature distinct from a visa; it will not require more information or place a heavier burden on applicants than a visa does. Holding a valid travel authorisation should be a new entry condition for the territory of the Member States. Mere possession of a travel authorisation should not, however, confer an automatic right of entry.</p>

It should also ensure a coordinated and harmonised assessment of third-country nationals subject to the travel authorisation requirement who intend to travel to Member States. Furthermore, it should enable applicants to be better informed of their eligibility to travel to Member States. In addition, ETIAS should contribute to the facilitation of border checks by reducing the number of refusals of entry at the external borders and by providing border guards with certain additional information related to flags.</p>

               <p>ETIAS should also support the objectives of the Schengen Information System (SIS) related to alerts on third-country nationals subject to a refusal of entry and stay, on persons wanted for arrest for surrender purposes or extradition purposes, on missing persons, on persons sought to assist with a judicial procedure and on persons for discreet checks or specific checks. For this purpose, ETIAS should compare relevant data from application files against relevant alerts in SIS. Where the comparison reveals a correspondence between personal data in the application file and alerts on third-country nationals subject to a refusal of entry and stay or on persons wanted for arrest for surrender purposes or extradition purposes, the application file should be processed manually by the ETIAS National Unit of the Member State responsible. The assessment performed by the ETIAS National Unit should lead to a decision whether to issue a travel authorisation or not. Where the comparison reveals a correspondence between personal data in the application file and alerts on missing persons, on persons sought to assist with a judicial procedure and on persons for discreet checks or specific checks, this information should be transferred to the SIRENE bureau and should be dealt with in accordance with the relevant legislation relating to SIS.</p>

It should also carry out regular audits of the processing of applications and of the implementation of the ETIAS screening rules, including by regularly assessing their impact on fundamental rights, in particular with regard to privacy and personal data protection.

They should also in no circumstances be based on information revealing a person&apos;s colour, race, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, political or any other opinion, religion or philosophical belief, trade union membership, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, or sexual orientation.

               <p>Issued travel authorisations should be annulled or revoked as soon as it becomes evident that the conditions for issuing them were not or are no longer met. In particular, where a new alert for refusal of entry and stay or an alert reporting a travel document as lost, stolen, misappropriated or invalidated is entered in SIS, SIS should inform ETIAS. ETIAS should then verify whether this new alert corresponds to a valid travel authorisation. Where a new refusal of entry and stay alert has been issued, the ETIAS National Unit of the Member State responsible should revoke the travel authorisation. Where the travel authorisation is linked to a travel document reported as lost, stolen, misappropriated or invalidated in SIS, or reported as lost, stolen or invalidated in SLTD, the ETIAS National Unit of the Member State responsible should manually process the application file. Following a similar approach, new data entered into the ETIAS watchlist should be compared with the application files stored in ETIAS in order to verify whether those new data correspond to a valid travel authorisation. In such cases, the ETIAS National Unit of the Member State that entered the new data, or the Member State of first intended stay in the case of data entered by Europol, should assess the hit and, where necessary, revoke the travel authorisation.

                     <p>A travel authorisation may be revoked at the request of the applicant. No appeal shall be possible against a revocation on this basis. If the applicant is present on the territory of a Member State when such a request is introduced, the revocation shall become effective once the applicant has exited the territory and from the moment the corresponding entry/exit record has been created in the EES in accordance with Articles 16(3) and 17(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2226.</p>

The carrier shall provide the data contained in the machine-readable zone of the travel document and indicate the Member State of entry. By way of derogation, in the case of airport transit, the carrier shall not be obliged to verify whether the third-country national is in possession of a valid travel authorisation.</p>

If a travel authorisation has been issued with limited territorial validity in accordance with Article 44, the response provided by the ETIAS Central System shall take into account the Member State(s) for which the authorisation is valid as well as the Member State of entry indicated by the carrier. Carriers may store the information sent and the answer received in accordance with the applicable law. The OK/NOT OK answer shall not be regarded as a decision to authorise or refuse entry in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/399.</p>

Where the automated processing does not report any hit, the ETIAS Central System shall issue an amended travel authorisation with the same validity period of the original and notify the applicant. Where the automated processing reports one or several hits, the ETIAS National Unit of the Member State responsible shall assess the security, illegal immigration or high epidemic risk in accordance with Article 26. It shall then decide whether to issue an amended travel authorisation or, where it concludes that the conditions for granting the travel authorisation are no longer met, revoke the travel authorisation.</p>
