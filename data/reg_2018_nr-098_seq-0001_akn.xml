               <p>By Council Regulation (EC) No 1147/2002<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="1">
                     <p>Council Regulation (EC) No 1147/2002 of 25 June 2002 temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain goods imported with airworthiness certificates (OJ L 170, 29.6.2002, p. 8).</p>
                  </authorialNote>, the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties were temporarily suspended for certain parts, components and other goods of a kind to be incorporated in or used for civil aircraft, when imported with airworthiness certificates. That Regulation simplified customs procedures for duty-free imports of parts, components and other goods used for the manufacture, repair, maintenance, rebuilding, modification or conversion of aircraft. However, due to extensive technical and legislative developments which have occurred since 2002, and in the interests of clarity, Regulation (EC) No 1147/2002 should be replaced.</p>

            <recital xml:id="rec_d88e78">
               <num>(2)</num>
               <p>According to information received from the Member States, the temporary suspension introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1147/2002 remains necessary in order to alleviate the administrative burden for both the economic operators in the aircraft sector and for the customs authorities of the Member States, as importations under special procedures with customs supervision such as end-use, inward processing or customs warehousing would be burdensome. The temporary suspension should therefore be continued.</p>

            <recital xml:id="rec_d88e84">
               <num>(3)</num>
               <p>In view of the fact that the prices for parts and components used in the aircraft sector are usually much higher than the prices for similar goods used for other purposes, the risk that the imported duty-free goods might be used in other industrial areas and, hence, the risk of abuse of the temporary suspension, is very low.</p>

                  </authorialNote> provides that in order for a part to be eligible for installation in a type-certificated product, it must be accompanied by an authorised release certificate (EASA Form 1) issued by a party authorised by aviation authorities within the Union. Therefore, the suspension of customs duties should be conditional on the availability of an authorised release certificate or, in the case of repair or maintenance of goods that have lost their airworthiness status, on the availability of a previous authorised release certificate.</p>
