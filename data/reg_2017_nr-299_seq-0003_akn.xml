               <p>In the area of the oversight of SIPS, the experience gained in conducting the first comprehensive assessment under Regulation (EU) No 795/2014 (ECB/2014/28) has demonstrated that certain amendments need to be made to Regulation (EC) No 2157/1999 (ECB/1999/4) to ensure that sanctions can be effectively imposed for oversight infringements.</p>

               <num>(4)</num>
               <p>In particular, clarification of the definition of a competent national central bank is required to ensure consistency with the definition of a competent authority in Regulation (EU) No 795/2014 (ECB/2014/28). In addition, clarification of the composition of the internal independent investigating unit is required to ensure it can independently perform its investigative functions in the field of payment systems oversight.</p>
