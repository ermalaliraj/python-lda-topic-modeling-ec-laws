               <p>Tropane alkaloids are secondary metabolites which naturally occur in plants of several families including <i>Brassicaceae</i>, <i>Solanaceae</i> and <i>Erythroxylaceae</i>. More than 200 TAs have been identified so far. The most studied tropane alkaloids are (-)-hyoscyamine and (-)-scopolamine. Atropine is the racemic mixture of (-)-hyoscyamine and (+)-hyoscyamine of which only the (-)-hyoscyamine enantiomer exhibits anticholinergic activity.</p>

               <p>The presence of tropane alkaloids in genus <i>Datura</i> is well known. <i>Datura stramonium</i> is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions and for this reason seeds of <i>Datura stramonium</i> have been found as impurities in linseed, soybean, sorghum, millet, sunflower and buckwheat and products thereof. The <i>Datura stramonium</i> seeds cannot be easily removed from sorghum, millet and buckwheat by sorting and cleaning and therefore sorghum, millet and buckwheat and their derived products and cereal based foods containing these are found to be contaminated with tropane alkaloids.</p>

               <p>The CONTAM Panel established a group Acute Reference Dose (&apos;ARfD&apos;) of 0,016 Î¼g/kg body weight (&apos;b.w.&apos;) expressed as the sum of (-)-hyoscyamine and (-)-scopolamine, assuming equivalent potency. The CONTAM Panel concluded that, based on the limited information available, the dietary exposure of toddlers could exceed significantly the group ARfD.</p>

               <p>It is therefore appropriate to establish a maximum level for (-)-hyoscyamine and (-)-scopolamine in cereal-based foods for infants and young children containing millet, sorghum, buckwheat or their derived products. However, as for analytical reason it is not always possible to distinguish between the enantiomers of hyoscyamine, it is appropriate to establish the maximum level for atropine and scopolamine. As the synthesis of tropane alkaloids in plants leads to (-)-hyoscyamine and (-)-scopolamine and not to (+)-hyoscyamine, analytical results on atropine in food of plant origin reflects the occurrence of (-)-hyoscyamine.</p>
