               <p>It is incumbent upon the Council to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, including, where appropriate, certain conditions functionally linked thereto. In accordance with Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, fishing opportunities are to be fixed in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) established in Article 2(2) of that Regulation. Article 16(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 provides that fishing opportunities be allocated to Member States in such a way as to ensure the relative stability of fishing activities of each Member State for each fish stock or fishery.</p>

                  </authorialNote> and entered into force on 16 July 2019. In accordance with Article 4(1) of that Regulation, fishing opportunities for stocks listed in Article 1 of that Regulation should be fixed to achieve fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield on a progressive, incremental basis by 2020 where possible, and by 1 January 2025 at the latest. Fishing opportunities should be expressed as maximum allowable fishing effort and fixed in accordance with the fishing effort regime laid down in Article 7 of that Regulation. For 2020, the maximum allowable fishing effort should therefore be reduced by 10 % compared to the baseline calculated in accordance with Article 7(4) of that Regulation.</p>

                     <p>Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas (OJ L 115, 9.5.1996, p. 3).</p>

Under Article 2 of that Regulation, when fixing the TACs, the Council is to decide to which stocks Article 3 or 4 of that Regulation is not to apply, in particular on the basis of the biological status of the stocks. More recently, the year-to-year flexibility mechanism was introduced by Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 for all stocks that are subject to the landing obligation. Therefore, in order to avoid excessive flexibility that would undermine the principle of rational and responsible exploitation of marine biological resources, hinder the achievement of the objectives of the CFP and cause the biological status of the stocks to deteriorate, it should be established that Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 apply to analytical TACs only where the year-to-year flexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is not used.</p>
