               <p>At its meeting on 25 and 26 June 2015, the European Council called for wider efforts in resolving unprecedented migratory flows towards Union territory in a comprehensive manner, including by reinforcing border management to better manage growing mixed migratory flows. Furthermore, at their informal meeting on migration on 23 September 2015, the Heads of State or Government stressed the need to tackle the dramatic situation at the external borders and to strengthen the controls at those borders, in particular through additional resources for the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), and Europol, with human resources and technical contributions from Member States.</p>

               <p>The objective of Union policy in the field of external border management is to develop and implement European integrated border management at national and Union level, which is a necessary corollary to the free movement of persons within the Union and is a fundamental component of an area of freedom, security and justice. European integrated border management is central to improving migration management. The aim is to manage the crossing of the external borders efficiently and address migratory challenges and potential future threats at those borders, thereby contributing to addressing serious crime with a cross-border dimension and ensuring a high level of internal security within the Union. At the same time, it is necessary to act in full respect for fundamental rights and in a manner that safeguards the free movement of persons within the Union.</p>

               <p>To ensure the effective implementation of European integrated border management, a European Border and Coast Guard should be established. It should be provided with the requisite financial and human resources and equipment. The European Border and Coast Guard should comprise the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (&apos;the Agency&apos;) and national authorities which are responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks. As such it will rely upon the common use of information, capabilities and systems at national level and the response of the Agency at Union level.</p>

               <p>European integrated border management should be implemented as a shared responsibility of the Agency and the national authorities responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out maritime border surveillance operations and any other border control tasks. While Member States retain the primary responsibility for the management of their external borders in their interest and in the interest of all Member States, the Agency should support the application of Union measures relating to the management of the external borders by reinforcing, assessing and coordinating the actions of Member States which implement those measures.</p>

               <p>The tasks of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union should therefore be expanded. To reflect those changes, it should be renamed the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, which will continue to be commonly referred to as Frontex. It should remain the same legal person, with full continuity in all its activities and procedures. The key role of the Agency should be to establish a technical and operational strategy for implementation of integrated border management at Union level; to oversee the effective functioning of border control at the external borders; to provide increased technical and operational assistance to Member States through joint operations and rapid border interventions; to ensure the practical execution of measures in a situation requiring urgent action at the external borders; to provide technical and operational assistance in the support of search and rescue operations for persons in distress at sea; and to organise, coordinate and conduct return operations and return interventions.</p>

It should coordinate its activities with Europol as the agency responsible for supporting and strengthening Member States&apos; actions and their cooperation in preventing and combating serious crime affecting two or more Member States. Cross-border crimes necessarily entail a cross-border dimension. Such a cross-border dimension is characterised by crimes directly linked to unauthorised crossings of the external borders, including trafficking in human beings or smuggling of migrants.

The Agency should ensure proper and effective monitoring not only through risk analysis, information exchange and European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR), but also through the presence of experts from its own staff in Member States. The Agency should therefore be able to deploy liaison officers to Member States for a period of time during which the liaison officer reports to the executive director.

This should include an assessment of the equipment, infrastructure, staff, budget and financial resources of Member States as well as their contingency plans to address possible crises at the external borders. Member States should take measures to address any deficiencies identified in that assessment. The executive director should identify the measures to be taken and recommend them to the Member State concerned. The executive director should also set a time-limit within which those measures should be taken.

               <p>Where control of the external border is rendered ineffective to such an extent that it risks jeopardising the functioning of the Schengen area, either because a Member State does not take the necessary measures in line with a vulnerability assessment or because a Member State facing specific and disproportionate challenges at the external borders has not requested sufficient support from the Agency or is not implementing such support, a unified, rapid and effective response should be delivered at Union level. For the purpose of mitigating these risks, and to ensure better coordination at Union level, the Commission should propose to the Council a decision identifying the measures to be implemented by the Agency and requiring the Member State concerned to cooperate with the Agency in the implementation of those measures. The implementing power to adopt such a decision should be conferred on the Council because of the potentially politically sensitive nature of the measures to be decided, which are likely to touch on national executive and enforcement powers. The Agency should determine the actions to be taken for the practical execution of the measures indicated in the Council decision. It should then draw up an operational plan with the Member State concerned. If a Member State does not comply within 30 days with that Council decision and does not cooperate with the Agency in the implementation of the measures contained in that decision, the Commission should be able to trigger the specific procedure provided for in Article 29 of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">

Their profiles shall be as defined in the decision of the management board. The total number of staff made available by the Member States shall amount to a minimum of 1500 border guards or other relevant staff.
