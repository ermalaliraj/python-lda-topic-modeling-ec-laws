               <p>Union households are amongst the highest savers in the world, but the bulk of those savings are held in bank accounts with short maturities. More investment into capital markets can help meet the challenges posed by population ageing and low interest rates.</p>

               <p>Old age pensions constitute an essential part of a retiree&apos;s income and for many people, adequate pension provision makes the difference between a comfortable old age and poverty. They are a precondition for exercising fundamental rights laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including in Article 25 on the rights of the elderly which states: &apos;The Union recognises and respects the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence and to participate in social and cultural life&apos;.</p>

               <p>The Union is facing several challenges, including demographic challenges because of the fact that Europe is an ageing continent.

               <p>A substantial part of old age pensions is provided under public schemes. Notwithstanding the exclusive national competence regarding the organisation of pension systems as determined by the Treaties, income adequacy and financial sustainability of national pension systems are crucial to the stability of the Union as a whole. By channelling more of Europeans&apos; savings from cash and bank deposits to long-term investment products, such as voluntary pension products with a long-term retirement nature, the impact would therefore be beneficial both for individuals (who would benefit from higher returns and improved pension adequacy) and for the broader economy.</p>

               <p>Currently, the internal market for personal pension products does not function smoothly. In some Member States there is not yet a market for personal pension products. In others, personal pension products are available, but there is a high degree of fragmentation between national markets. As a result, personal pension products have only a limited degree of portability. This can result in difficulties for individuals to make use of their basic freedoms. For instance, they might be prevented from taking up a job or retiring in another Member State. In addition, the possibility for providers to use the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services is hampered by the lack of standardisation of existing personal pension products.</p>

               <p>As the internal market for personal pension products is fragmented and diverse, the impact of PEPPs might be very different across Member States, and the target audience might be equally varied. In some Member States, PEPPs might offer solutions for people who do not currently have access to adequate provisions. In other Member States, PEPPs could broaden the consumer choice, or offer solutions to mobile citizens. However, PEPPs should not aim at replacing existing national pension systems, since it is an additional and complementary personal pension product.</p>

               <p>The capital markets union (CMU) will help mobilise capital in Europe and channel it to all companies, including small and medium enterprises, infrastructure and long-term sustainable projects that need it to expand and create jobs. One of the main objectives of the CMU is to increase investment and choices for retail investors by putting European savings to better use. For this purpose, a PEPP will represent a step forward for the enhancement of the capital markets integration due to its support to the long-term financing of the real economy taking into account the long-term retirement nature of the product and the sustainability of investments.</p>

               <p>A PEPP is an individual non-occupational pension product subscribed to voluntarily by a PEPP saver in view of retirement.

               <p>This Regulation harmonises a set of core features for the PEPP, which concern key elements such as distribution, minimum content of contracts, investment policy, provider switching, or cross-border provision and portability. The harmonisation of those core features will improve the level playing field for personal pension providers at large and help boost the completion of the CMU and the integration of the internal market for personal pensions. It will lead to the creation of a largely standardised pan-European product, available in all Member States, empowering consumers to make full use of the internal market by transferring their pension rights abroad and offering a broader choice between different types of providers, including in a cross-border way. As a result of fewer barriers to the provision of pension services across borders, a PEPP will increase competition between providers on a pan-European basis and create economies of scale that should benefit savers.</p>

               <p>Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) allows the adoption of acts both in the shape of regulations or directives. The adoption of a regulation has been preferred as it would become directly applicable in all Member States. Therefore, a regulation would allow a quicker uptake of the PEPP and contribute more rapidly to address the need for more pension savings and investments in the CMU context. This Regulation is harmonising the core features of PEPPs which do not have to be subject to specific national rules and so, a regulation appears better suited than a directive in this case. On the contrary, the features which are outside the scope of this Regulation (e.g. accumulation phase conditions) are subject to national rules.</p>

In some Member States, those institutions are only allowed to carry out occupational pension activities whereas in other Member States, those institutions, including the authorised entities responsible for operating them and acting on their behalf, where IORPs do not have legal personality, are allowed to carry out occupational and personal pension activities. This has not only lead to different organisational structures of IORPs but is also accompanied by different supervision on national level. In particular, prudential supervision of IORPs which are authorised to provide occupational and personal pension activities is broader than of those IORPs which only carry out occupational pension activities. In order not to jeopardise financial stability and to take into account the different organisational structure and supervision, only those IORPs which are also authorised and supervised to provide personal pension products pursuant to national law should be allowed to provide PEPPs. Moreover and to further safeguard financial stability, all assets and liabilities corresponding to the PEPP provision business should be ring-fenced, without any possibility to transfer them to the other retirement provision business of the institution. IORPs that provide PEPPs should also at all times comply with the relevant standards set by Directive (EU) 2016/2341, including the more detailed investment rules laid down by the Member States where they are registered or authorised in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2341 when transposing that Directive, and the provisions of their system of governance.

               <p>Under the freedom to provide services or the freedom of establishment, PEPP providers can provide PEPPs and PEPP distributors can distribute PEPPs within the territory of a host Member State after opening of a sub-account for that host Member State. In order to ensure a high quality of service and effective consumer protection, home and host Member States should closely cooperate in the enforcement of the obligations set out in this Regulation. Where PEPP providers and PEPP distributors pursue business in different Member States under the freedom to provide services, the competent authorities of the home Member State should be responsible for ensuring compliance with the obligations set out in this Regulation, because of their closer links with the PEPP provider. In order to ensure fair sharing of responsibilities between the competent authorities from the home and the host Member States, if the competent authorities of a host Member State become aware of any infringement of obligations occurring within their territory, they should inform the competent authorities of the home Member State which should then be obliged to take the appropriate measures. Moreover, the competent authorities of the host Member State should be entitled to intervene if the competent authorities of the home Member State fail to take appropriate measures or if the measures taken are insufficient.</p>

They can also benefit from the advantages of international diversification. Investments in shares in currencies other than those of the liabilities and in other instruments that have a long-term economic profile and are not traded on regulated markets, MTFs or OTFs should therefore not be restricted, in line with the prudent person rule so as to protect the interest of PEPP savers and PEPP beneficiaries, except on prudential grounds.</p>

               <p>In the context of deepening the CMU, the understanding of what constitutes instruments with a long-term economic profile is broad. Such instruments are non-transferable securities and therefore do not have access to the liquidity of secondary markets. They often require fixed term commitments which restrict their marketability and should be understood to include participation and debt instruments in, and loans provided to, non-listed undertakings. Non-listed undertakings include infrastructure projects, unlisted companies seeking growth, real estate or other assets that could be suitable for long-term investment purposes. Low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure projects are often non-listed assets and rely on long-term credits for project financing. Considering the long-term nature of their liabilities, PEPP providers are encouraged to allocate a sufficient part of their asset portfolio to sustainable investments in the real economy with long-term economic benefits, in particular to infrastructure projects and corporates.</p>

The Commission should be empowered to adopt such regulatory technical standards which should be developed by EIOPA. In drawing up the draft regulatory technical standards, EIOPA should, in particular, consider the long-term nature of the PEPP, the different types of PEPPs and the cost-relevant factors linked to their specific features, so as to ensure a fair and equal treatment of the different PEPP providers and their products while taking into account the character of the Basic PEPP as a simple, cost-efficient and transparent product providing a sufficient long-term real investment return. Moreover, with the aim of preserving the long-term retirement nature of the product, the form of out-payments, in particular with respect to lifelong annuities, should be carefully assessed. Within that framework, in order to ensure that PEPP providers offering a capital guarantee benefit of a level playing field with other providers, EIOPA should duly take into account the structure of costs and fees. Furthermore, the percentage values for costs and fees should be regularly revised in order to ensure their continued adequacy taking into account any changes in the level of costs. The Commission should adopt those regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.

               <p>In order to fulfil the objectives set out in this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the conditions for the exercise of intervention powers by EIOPA and the competent authorities and the criteria and factors to be applied by EIOPA to determine when there is a significant PEPP saver protection concern. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="13">

In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States&apos; experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>

               <p>Without prejudice to the right of PEPP customers to bring action in the courts, easily accessible, adequate, independent, impartial, transparent and effective alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures should be established between PEPP providers or PEPP distributors and PEPP customers for resolving disputes arising from the rights and obligations set out in this Regulation.</p>

               <p>With a view to establishing an efficient and effective dispute resolution procedure, PEPP providers and PEPP distributors should put in place an effective complaints procedure that can be followed by their customers before the dispute is referred to be resolved in an ADR procedure or before a court. The complaints procedure should contain short and clearly defined timeframes within which the PEPP provider or PEPP distributor should reply to a complaint. ADR bodies should have sufficient capacity to engage in an adequate and efficient way in cross-border cooperation with regard to disputes concerning rights and obligations pursuant to this Regulation.</p>

               <p>In order to find better conditions for their investments, thus also stimulating the competition among PEPP providers, PEPP savers should have the right to switch to a different PEPP provider located in the same or another Member State during the accumulation phase, through a clear, quick and safe procedure. However, PEPP providers should not be obliged to provide the switching service for PEPPs, where savers are receiving out-payments in the form of lifetime annuities. During switching, transferring PEPP providers should transfer the corresponding amounts or, where applicable, assets-in-kind from the PEPP account and close it. PEPP savers should conclude contracts with receiving PEPP providers for the opening of a new PEPP account. The new PEPP account should have the same sub-account structure as the former PEPP account.</p>

               <p>During the switching service, PEPP savers can choose to transfer assets-in-kind only when the switching is between PEPP providers, such as investment firms or other eligible providers holding an additional licence, engaged in portfolio management for PEPP savers. Written consent of the receiving provider is needed in that case. In the case of collective investment management, the switching of assets-in-kind is not possible as there is no separation of assets for every PEPP saver.</p>

               <p>The switching process should be straightforward for the PEPP saver. Accordingly, the receiving PEPP provider should be responsible for initiating and managing the process on behalf of the PEPP saver and upon his request. PEPP providers should be able to use additional means, such as a technical solution, on a voluntary basis when establishing the switching service. Considering the pan-European nature of the product, PEPP savers should be able to switch without delay and free of charge when no sub-account is available in the Member State the PEPP saver moves to.</p>

               <p>The cooperation of the transferring PEPP provider is necessary in order for the switching to be successful. Therefore, the receiving PEPP provider should be provided by the transferring PEPP provider with all the information necessary to reinstate the payments on the other PEPP account. However, such information should not exceed what is necessary in order to carry out the switching.</p>

               <p>PEPP savers should not be subject to financial losses, including charges and interest, caused by any mistakes made by either of the PEPP providers involved in the switching process. In particular, PEPP savers should not bear any financial loss deriving from the payment of additional fees, interest or other charges as well as fines, penalties or any other type of financial detriment due to delay in the execution of the switching. As capital protection should be ensured at the start of the decumulation phase and during the decumulation phase, where applicable, the transferring PEPP provider should not be obliged to ensure the capital protection or guarantee at the moment of switching. The PEPP provider might also decide to ensure the capital protection or provide the guarantee at the moment of switching.</p>

               <p>PEPP savers should have the possibility to make an informed decision before switching. The receiving PEPP provider should comply with all the distribution and information requirements, including the provision of a PEPP KID, advice and adequate information regarding the costs related to the switching and the possible negative implications on the capital protection when a PEPP with a guarantee is being switched. Costs for the switching applied by the transferring PEPP provider should be kept to an amount that does not constitute an obstacle to mobility and in any case, be limited to 0,5 % of the corresponding amounts or monetary value of the assets-in-kind to be transferred.</p>

               <p>PEPP savers should be given the freedom to decide upon subscription of a PEPP and when opening a new sub-account about their pay-out choice (annuities, lump sum, or other) in the decumulation phase, but with a possibility to revise their choice one year before the start of the decumulation phase, at the start of the decumulation phase and at the moment of switching, in order to be able to best adapt their pay-out choice to their needs when they near retirement. If the PEPP provider makes available more than one form of out-payments, it should be possible for the PEPP saver to opt for a different pay-out choice for each sub-account opened in his PEPP account.</p>

               <p>PEPP providers should be allowed to make available to PEPP savers a wide range of forms of out-payments. That approach would achieve the goal of enhanced take-up of the PEPP through increased flexibility and choice for PEPP savers. It would allow providers to design their PEPPs in the most cost-effective way. It is coherent with other Union policies and politically feasible, as it preserves enough flexibility for Member States to decide about which forms of out-payments they wish to encourage. In line with the long-term retirement nature of the product, it should be possible for Member States to adopt measures to privilege particular forms of out-payments such as quantitative limits for lump sum payments to further encourage lifelong annuities and drawdown payments.</p>

               <p>In view of the pan-European character of the PEPP, there is a need to ensure a consistent high level of PEPP saver protection throughout the internal market. This requires adequate tools to effectively combat infringements and prevent consumer detriment. Therefore, the powers of EIOPA and the competent authorities should be complemented by an explicit mechanism for prohibiting or restricting the marketing, distribution or sale of any PEPP giving rise to serious concerns regarding PEPP saver protection, including with respect to the long-term retirement nature of the product, the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets, or the stability of the whole or part of the financial system, together with appropriate coordination and contingency powers for EIOPA. The powers of EIOPA should be based on Article 9(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 so as to ensure that such mechanisms for intervention can be applied in the case of significant PEPP saver protection concerns, including with respect to the particular long-term retirement nature of the PEPP. Where the conditions are met, the competent authorities should be able to impose a prohibition or restriction on a precautionary basis before a PEPP has been marketed, distributed or sold to PEPP savers. Those powers do not relieve the PEPP provider of its responsibility to comply with all the relevant requirements under this Regulation.</p>
