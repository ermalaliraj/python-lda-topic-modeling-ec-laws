               <p>The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) requires a high level of protection of human and animal health and of the environment to be ensured in the definition and implementation of Union policies and activities.

               <p>Union legislation provides for a set of harmonised rules to ensure that food and feed are safe and wholesome, and that activities which might have an impact on the safety of the agri-food chain or on the protection of consumers&apos; interests in relation to food and food information are performed in accordance with specific requirements. Union rules exist also to ensure a high level of human, animal and plant health as well as animal welfare along the agri-food chain and in all those areas of activity where a key objective is the fight against the possible spread of animal diseases, in some cases transmissible to humans, or of pests injurious to plants or plant products, and to ensure the protection of the environment from risks that might arise from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or plant protection products. The correct application of those rules, hereinafter collectively referred to as &apos;Union agri-food chain legislation&apos;, contributes to the functioning of the internal market.</p>

                     <p>Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and setting out procedures in matters of food safety (OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote>. In addition to those basic rules, more specific food and feed law covers different areas such as animal nutrition, including medicated feedingstuffs, food and feed hygiene, zoonoses, animal by-products, residues of veterinary medicinal products, contaminants, control and eradication of animal diseases with a human health impact, food and feed labelling, plant protection products, food and feed additives, vitamins, mineral salts, trace elements and other additives, food contact materials, quality and compositional requirements, drinking water, ionisation, novel foods and GMOs.</p>

               <p>Union legislation on animal health aims to ensure high standards of human and animal health in the Union, the rational development of the agriculture and aquaculture sectors, and to increase productivity. That legislation is necessary to contribute to the completion of the internal market for animals and animal products and to avoid the spread of infectious diseases of Union concern. It covers areas that include intra-Union trade, entry into the Union, disease eradication, veterinary controls and notification of diseases, and also contributes to the safety of food and feed.</p>

               <p>Transmissible animal diseases, including by micro-organisms that have developed resistance to antimicrobials, may have a significant impact on public health, food and feed safety, and animal health and welfare. In order to ensure high standards of animal and public health in the Union, rules on animal health measures and on feed and food safety are laid down at Union level. Compliance with those rules, including the rules that are intended to tackle the problem of antimicrobial resistance, should be subjected to the official controls provided for in this Regulation. Additionally, Union legislation provides for rules on the placing on the market and use of veterinary medicinal products which contribute to coherent action at Union level directed at enforcing the prudent use of antimicrobials at farm level and at minimising the development of antimicrobial resistance in animals and its transmission through food of animal origin. Actions number 2 and 3 advocated by the Communication of 15 November 2011 from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council entitled &apos;Action plan against the rising threats from Antimicrobial Resistance&apos; emphasise the essential role played by the specific Union rules in the area of veterinary medicinal products. Compliance with those specific rules should be subjected to the controls provided for in that Union legislation and, therefore, does not fall within the scope of this Regulation.</p>

In some of those areas, Union legislation lays down detailed requirements to be complied with which require special skills and specific means for the performance of official controls. To avoid diverging enforcement practices which could generate uneven protection of human, animal and plant health, animal welfare and, as regards GMOs and plant protection products, also of the environment, disrupt the functioning of the internal market for animals and goods falling within the scope of this Regulation and distort competition, the Commission should be able to supplement the rules laid down in this Regulation through the adoption of specific official control rules capable of catering for the needs of controls of those areas. In particular, such rules should lay down specific requirements for the performance of official controls and the minimum frequency for such controls, specific or additional measures to those provided for in this Regulation that competent authorities should take in relation to cases of non-compliance, specific responsibilities and tasks of the competent authorities in addition to those provided for in this Regulation and specific criteria for triggering the administrative assistance mechanism provided for in this Regulation. In other cases, such additional rules might become necessary in order to provide a more detailed framework for the performance of official controls in relation to food and feed, where new information emerges about risks to human or animal health or, in relation to GMOs and plant protection products, also to the environment, indicating that in the absence of common specifications for the performance of official controls across the Member States, the controls would fail to deliver the expected level of protection against those risks, as provided for by Union agri-food chain legislation.</p>

               <p>In order to reinforce the efficiency of the Union&apos;s official control system, ensure an optimal allocation of official control resources assigned to border controls and facilitate the enforcement of Union agri-food chain legislation, a common integrated system of official controls at border control posts, replacing the current fragmented control frameworks, should be established to handle all consignments which, given the risk they may carry, should be controlled on their entry into the Union.</p>

               <p>Official controls should be performed on consignments upon their arrival at border control posts. Those official controls should include documentary checks on all consignments, including where appropriate checks by electronic means, as well as identity checks and physical checks performed at an appropriate frequency dependent on the risk posed by each consignment of animals or goods.</p>

               <p>The frequency of physical checks should be determined and modified on the basis of risks to human, animal or plant health, animal welfare or, as regards GMOs and plant protection products, also to the environment. That approach should enable the competent authorities to allocate resources for controls where the risk is highest. The frequency of identity checks should also be subject to reduction or limited to the verification of a consignment&apos;s official seal where this is justified by a reduced risk posed by the consignments entering the Union. The risk-based approach to identity checks and physical checks should be pursued by making use of available data sets and information, and of computerised data collection and management systems.</p>

               <p>Member States should ensure that adequate financial resources are always available in order to appropriately staff and equip the competent authorities performing official controls and other official activities. Although operators are primarily responsible for ensuring that their activities are carried out in compliance with Union agri-food chain legislation, the system of own controls that they put in place for that purpose should be complemented by a dedicated system of official controls maintained by each Member State to ensure effective market surveillance along the agri-food chain. Such a system is, by its very nature, complex and resource-demanding and should be provided with a stable influx of resources for official controls, and at a level appropriate to the enforcement needs at any given moment. To reduce the dependency of the official control system on public finances, competent authorities should collect fees or charges to cover the costs they incur when performing official controls on certain operators and for certain activities for which Union agri-food chain legislation requires registration or approval in accordance with Union rules on the hygiene of food and feed or rules governing plant health. Fees or charges should also be collected from operators to compensate the costs of official controls performed in view of issuing an official certificate or attestation and costs of official controls performed by the competent authorities at border control posts.</p>

               <p>Fees or charges should cover, but not exceed, the costs, including overhead costs, incurred by the competent authorities to perform official controls. Overhead costs could include the costs of the support and organisation necessary for planning and carrying out the official controls. Such costs should be calculated on the basis of each individual official control or on the basis of all official controls performed over a given period of time. Where fees or charges are applied on the basis of the actual cost of individual official controls, operators with a good record of compliance should bear lower overall charges than non-compliant ones, as they should be subject to less frequent official controls. In order to promote compliance with Union legislation by all operators irrespective of the method (based on actual costs or on a flat rate) that each Member States has chosen for the calculation of the fees or charges, when fees or charges are calculated on the basis of overall costs incurred by the competent authorities over a given period of time, and imposed on all operators irrespective of whether they are subject to an official control during the reference period, those fees or charges should be calculated so as to reward operators with a consistent good record of compliance with Union agri-food chain legislation.</p>

The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) established pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 already enables competent authorities to rapidly exchange and disseminate information on serious direct or indirect risks to human health in relation to food or feed, or serious risks to human or animal health or to the environment in relation to feed, for the purpose of enabling rapid measures to be taken to counter those serious risks. However, that instrument, while allowing for timely action across all Member States concerned to counter certain serious risks along the agri-food chain, cannot serve the purpose of enabling effective cross border assistance and cooperation between competent authorities to ensure that cases of non-compliance with Union agri-food chain legislation which have a cross-border dimension are effectively pursued not only in the Member State where the non-compliance is first detected but also in the Member State where the non-compliance originated. In particular, administrative assistance and cooperation should enable competent authorities to share information, detect, investigate and take effective and proportionate action to pursue cross-border violations of Union agri-food chain legislation also in cases where potential fraudulent or deceptive practices have or could have a cross-border dimension.</p>

               <p>The competent authorities should investigate cases where there is a suspicion of non-compliance with Union agri-food chain legislation and, where non-compliance is established, determine its origin and extent as well as the operators&apos; responsibilities. The competent authorities should also take appropriate measures to ensure that the operators concerned remedy the situation and to prevent further non-compliance. The organisation and performance of investigations and enforcement actions by the competent authorities should duly take into account potential risks and the likelihood of fraudulent or deceptive practices along the agri-food chain.</p>

               <p>The verification of compliance with Union agri-food chain legislation through official controls is of fundamental importance to ensure that, across the Union, the objectives of that legislation are effectively achieved. Disruptions in a Member State&apos;s control systems can in certain cases substantially hinder the achievement of those objectives and lead to the emergence of risks to human, animal and plant health, animal welfare or, as regards GMOs and plant protection products, also to the environment, independently of the involvement or responsibility of operators or other actors, or lead to situations of widespread serious non-compliance with Union agri-food chain legislation. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, the Commission should be able, in the event of serious disruptions in a Member State&apos;s control system, to react by adopting measures aimed at containing or eliminating those risks from the agri-food chain, pending the necessary action to be taken by the Member State concerned to remedy the disruption in the control system. Implementing powers should therefore be conferred on the Commission.</p>

It is also clear that it is justified to have an exemption from the obligation of documentary checks to be carried out at border control posts for the plant sector in the case of plants, plant products and other objects posing a low level of risk and to permit documentary checks at a distance from border control posts for plants, plant products and other objects where such checks at a distance are able to provide an equal level of assurance.</p>
