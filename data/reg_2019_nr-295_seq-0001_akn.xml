               <p>The objective of Union policy in the field of external border management is to develop and implement European integrated border management at national and Union level, which is a necessary corollary to the free movement of persons within the Union and is a fundamental component of an area of freedom, security and justice. European integrated border management is central to improving migration management. The aim is to manage the crossing of the external borders efficiently and address migratory challenges and potential future threats at those borders, thereby contributing to addressing serious crime with a cross-border dimension and ensuring a high level of internal security within the Union. At the same time, it is necessary to act in full respect for fundamental rights and in a manner that safeguards the free movement of persons within the Union.</p>

               <p>The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union has been renamed the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (the &apos;Agency&apos;), commonly referred to as Frontex, and its tasks have been expanded with full continuity in all its activities and procedures. The key roles of the Agency should be: to establish a technical and operational strategy as part of the implementation of the multiannual strategic policy cycle for European integrated border management; to oversee the effective functioning of border control at the external borders; to carry out risk analysis and vulnerability assessments; to provide increased technical and operational assistance to Member States and third countries through joint operations and rapid border interventions; to ensure the practical execution of measures in a situation requiring urgent action at the external borders; to provide technical and operational assistance in the support of search and rescue operations for persons in distress at sea; and to organise, coordinate and conduct return operations and return interventions.</p>

               <p>Since the beginning of the migratory crisis in 2015, the Commission has taken up important initiatives and has proposed a series of measures with a view to strengthening the protection of the external borders and restoring the normal functioning of the Schengen area. A proposal for significantly enhancing the mandate of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders was presented in December 2015 and negotiated swiftly in 2016. The resulting regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">
                     <p>Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 September 2016 on the European Border and Coast Guard and amending Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Regulation (EC) No 863/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 and Council Decision 2005/267/EC (OJ L 251, 16.9.2016, p. 1).</p>

               <p>However, the Union framework in the areas of external border control, return, combating cross-border crime, and asylum still needs to be further improved. To that end, and to further underpin the current and future envisaged operational efforts, the European Border and Coast Guard should be reformed by giving the Agency a stronger mandate and, in particular, by providing it with the necessary capabilities in the form of a European Border and Coast Guard standing corps (the &apos;standing corps&apos;). The standing corps should gradually but swiftly reach the strategic target of having a capacity of 10000 operational staff, as set out in Annex I, with executive powers, where applicable, to effectively support Member States on the ground in their efforts to protect the external borders, to fight cross-border crime and to significantly step up the effective and sustainable return of irregular migrants. Such a capacity of 10000 operational staff represents the maximum available capacity required to effectively address existing and future operational needs for border and return operations in the Union and third countries, including a rapid reaction capacity to face future crises.</p>

Air border surveillance aims to detect and monitor such suspicious flights crossing or intending to cross the external borders and to perform related risk analysis with a view to triggering reaction capabilities by the competent authorities of the Union and the Member States. For that purpose, inter-agency cooperation at Union level should be promoted between the Agency, the Network Manager of the European Air Traffic Management Network (EATMN) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The dedicated financing system should strike the right balance between the risks of irregularities and fraud and costs of control. This Regulation sets the essential conditions for triggering the financial support, namely the recruitment and training of the adequate number of border guards or other specialists corresponding to the number of officers seconded to the Agency for a long term or the effective deployment of officers during the Agency&apos;s operational activities for a consecutive or non-consecutive period of at least four months or on a pro-rata basis for deployments for a consecutive or a non-consecutive period of less than four months. Given the lack of relevant and comparable data on actual costs across Member States, the development of a cost-based financing scheme would be overly complex and would not address the need for a simple, fast, efficient and effective financing scheme. For the purpose of fixing the amount of such financing to different Member States, it is appropriate to use as a reference amount the annual salary of contractual agents in function group III, grade 8, step 1 of the institutions of the Union, adjusted by a corrective coefficient per Member State in line with the principle of sound financial management and in the spirit of equal treatment.

               <p>In order to allow for effective deployments from the standing corps beginning on 1 January 2021, certain decisions and implementing measures should be taken and put in place as soon as possible. Therefore, the Agency, together with the Member States and the Commission, should engage in the preparation of such implementing measures and decisions for adoption by the management board. Such a preparatory process should encompass the relevant recruitment by the Agency and the Member States as referred to in this Regulation.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure the continuity of the support for operational activities organised by the Agency, however, all deployments, including under the rapid reaction pool, to be made by 31 December 2020 should be planned and implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 and in accordance with the annual bilateral negotiations carried out in 2019. To that end, the relevant provisions of that Regulation should only be repealed with effect from 1 January 2021.</p>

               <p>The Agency&apos;s workforce should consist of staff performing the tasks devoted to the Agency, either in the Agency&apos;s headquarters or as part of the standing corps.

               <p>To overcome the persistent gaps in the voluntary pooling of technical equipment from Member States, in particular as regards large-scale assets, the Agency should have its own necessary equipment to be deployed in joint operations or rapid border interventions or any other operational activities. Those assets should be authorised by the Member States as being on government service. While the Agency has been legally able to acquire or lease its own technical equipment since 2011, that possibility was significantly hindered by the lack of budgetary resources.</p>

               <p>Consequently, in order to match the level of ambition underlying the establishment of the standing corps, the Commission earmarked a significant envelope under the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework to allow the Agency to acquire, maintain and operate the necessary air, sea and land assets corresponding to its operational needs. While the acquisition of the necessary assets could be a lengthy process, especially for large assets, the Agency&apos;s own equipment should ultimately become the backbone of the operational deployments with additional contributions by Member States to be called upon in exceptional circumstances. The Agency&apos;s equipment should be largely operated by the Agency&apos;s technical crews that are part of the standing corps. In order to ensure the effective use of the proposed financial resources, the acquisition of the necessary assets should be based on a multiannual strategy decided as early as possible by the management board. It is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the Agency by means of future multiannual financial frameworks and to maintain comprehensive European integrated border management.</p>

               <p>In the context of return, third-country nationals frequently do not hold any identification documents and do not cooperate as regards the establishment of their identity by withholding information or providing incorrect personal data. Given the particular policy need for expedient return procedures, it is necessary for the Agency to be able to restrict certain rights of data subjects so as to prevent the abuse of such rights from impeding the proper implementation of return procedures and the successful enforcement of return decisions by the Member States or from preventing the Agency from performing its tasks efficiently. In particular, the exercise of the right to the restriction of processing could significantly delay and obstruct the carrying out of the return operations. Furthermore, in some cases, the right of access by the third-country national could jeopardise a return operation by increasing the risk of absconding should the third-country national learn that the Agency is processing his or her data in the context of a planned return operation. The right to rectification could increase the risk that the third-country national in question will mislead the authorities by providing incorrect data. In order to enable the Agency to restrict certain rights of data subjects, it should be able to adopt internal rules on such restrictions.</p>

               <p>In order to properly implement its tasks in the area of return, including by assisting Member States in the proper implementation of return procedures and the successful enforcement of return decisions, as well as to facilitate return operations, the Agency might need to transfer the personal data of returnees to third countries. The third countries of return are not often subject to adequacy decisions adopted by the Commission under Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or under Article 36 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, and have often not concluded or do not intend to conclude a readmission agreement with the Union or otherwise provide for appropriate safeguards within the meaning of Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 or within the meaning of the national provisions transposing Article 37 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, despite the extensive efforts of the Union in cooperating with the main countries of origin of illegally staying third-country nationals subject to an obligation to return, it is not always possible to ensure that such third countries systematically comply with the obligation established by international law to readmit their own nationals. Readmission agreements concluded or being negotiated by the Union or the Member States which provide for appropriate safeguards for personal data cover a limited number of such third countries. Where such agreements do not yet exist, personal data should be transferred by the Agency for the purposes of facilitating the return operations of the Union, provided that the conditions laid down in point (d) of Article 50(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 are met.</p>

The fundamental rights officer should review the admissibility of a complaint, register admissible complaints, forward all registered complaints to the executive director, forward complaints concerning members of the teams to the home Member State, and register the follow-up by the Agency or that Member State. The mechanism should be effective, ensuring that complaints are properly followed up. The complaints mechanism should be without prejudice to access to administrative and judicial remedies and not constitute a requirement for seeking such remedies. Criminal investigations should be conducted by the Member States. In order to increase transparency and accountability, the Agency should report on the complaints mechanism in its annual report. The report should cover in particular the number of complaints it has received, the types of fundamental rights violations involved, the operations concerned and, where possible, the follow-up measures taken by the Agency and Member States. The fundamental rights officer should have access to all information concerning respect for fundamental rights in relation to all the activities of the Agency. The fundamental rights officer should be provided with the resources and staff necessary to enable him or her to effectively perform all his or her tasks in accordance with this Regulation. The staff provided to the fundamental rights officer should have the skills and seniority that correspond to the expansion of activities and powers of the Agency.</p>

In that context, the Agency shall assess the national capability development plans referred to in Article 9(4) as regards the capacity to perform border control taking into account the fact that some national capabilities may be partially used for purposes other than border control. For future planning, the Agency shall carry out such monitoring and assessment as a preventive measure on the basis of the risk analyses prepared in accordance with Article 29(2). The Agency shall carry out such monitoring and assessment at least once a year, unless the executive director, on the basis of risk analysis or a previous vulnerability assessment, decides otherwise. In any event, each Member State shall be subject to monitoring and assessment at least once every three years.</p>

That assessment shall be without prejudice to the Schengen evaluation mechanism.</p>

                        <p>A Member State may request that the Agency launch joint operations to face upcoming challenges, including illegal immigration, present or future threats at its external borders or cross-border crime, or provide increased technical and operational assistance when implementing its obligations with regard to external border control. As part of such a request, a Member State may also indicate the profiles of operational staff needed for the joint operation in question, including those staff having executive powers, as applicable.</p>
