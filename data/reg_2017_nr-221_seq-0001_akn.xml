Among others, the UNSC added nine natural persons and four legal persons to the list of persons and entities subject to restrictive measures. The UNSC also laid down exemptions from those measures with regard to two legal persons, namely, the Foreign Trade Bank (FTB) and the Korean National Insurance Company (KNIC).</p>
