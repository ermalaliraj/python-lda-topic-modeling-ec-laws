               <p>A new regulatory approach has been introduced in respect of Union engine type-approval legislation, with the aim of simplifying and accelerating the adoption of such legislation. Pursuant to that approach, the legislator sets out the fundamental rules and principles and empowers the Commission to adopt delegated and implementing acts concerning further technical details. Therefore, with regard to substantive requirements, this Regulation should lay down only essential provisions on the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants and type-approval for internal combustion engines for non-road mobile machinery, and should empower the Commission to lay down the technical specifications in delegated and implementing acts.</p>

However, that Directive does not lay down gaseous and particulate pollutant emission requirements for engines for non-road mobile machinery. Certain specific obligations for non-road mobile machinery manufacturers should therefore be laid down in order to ensure that the installation of engines in such machinery is carried out in a manner that does not adversely affect engine performance with regard to gaseous and particulate pollutant emissions. Certain obligations relating to aspects of the emission limits for gaseous and particulate pollutants from engines for non-road mobile machinery are also necessary, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the emission limits for engines laid down in this Regulation.</p>

               <p>This Regulation should contain substantive requirements relating to emission limits and EU type-approval procedures for engines for non-road mobile machinery. The main elements of the relevant requirements of this Regulation are based on the results of the impact assessment of 20 November 2013 carried out by the Commission and in which the different options were analysed by listing potential advantages and disadvantages in terms of economic, environmental, safety and societal aspects and in terms of health effects. Both qualitative and quantitative aspects were included in that analysis.</p>

               <p>With a view to ensuring the functioning of the internal market, this Regulation should lay down harmonised rules for the EU type-approval of engines for non-road mobile machinery. For that purpose, new emission limits should be established and applied to engines for non-road mobile machinery as well as for agricultural and forestry machinery, to reflect technological progress and to ensure convergence with Union policies in the on-road sector. Those new emission limits should be established with a view to achieving Union air quality targets and reducing the emissions from non-road mobile machinery and agricultural and forestry vehicles, thus decreasing the share of non-road mobile machinery emissions in relation to road vehicle emissions. Accordingly, the scope of Union legislation in this field should be broadened, with a view to improving market harmonisation at Union and international level and minimising the risk of market distortions and adverse health effects.</p>

Given that the progress of those modes of transport compares unfavourably with that of other sectors in relation to improving air quality, the Commission and Member States&apos; authorities, within their respective remits, should provide different ways of supporting innovation in emission technology so that the continuing increase in the volume of freight shifted to rail and inland waterways goes hand-in-hand with an improvement in air quality in Europe.</p>

Union legislation has established appropriate emission limits for ambient air quality for the protection of human health and sensitive individuals in particular, as well as for national emission ceilings<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="7">

Following its Communication of 4 May 2001, which established the Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Programme, on 21 September 2005 the Commission adopted another Communication entitled &apos;Thematic Strategy on air pollution&apos;. One of the conclusions of that thematic strategy is that further reductions in emissions from the transport sector (air, maritime and land transport), from households and from the energy, agricultural and industrial sectors are needed to achieve Union air quality objectives. In that context, the task of reducing emissions from engines for non-road mobile machinery should be approached as part of an overall strategy. The new emissions limits, referred to as &apos;Stage V&apos;, are one of the measures designed to reduce the current in-use emissions of air pollutants, such as particulate pollutants, as well as ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and hydrocarbons.</p>

Those manufacturers are typically small and medium-sized enterprises (&apos;SMEs&apos;) that have limited engineering capacity and often obtain information regarding future stage engines later than other OEMs. This is the case, in particular, of agricultural machinery manufacturers producing a limited number of units per year that would face a serious structural challenge when undertaking the transition to Stage V emission limits.

               <p>According to current estimates, a number of broad gauge line locomotives will need to be replaced between 2016 and 2025. High-power engine locomotives suitable for the 1520 mm railway network are not available on the Union market. Custom-built solutions would significantly increase the cost of a new locomotive and would deter railway operators from renewing their fleets. The technical and economic constraints of the 1520 mm railway network should be considered in the EU type-approval procedures. In order to facilitate and speed up the greening of the railway sector in the Member States affected and to promote the use of the best technology currently available on the market, a temporary exemption in respect of certain requirements should be granted for those locomotives on the railway network. Such an exemption could allow the impact of rail traffic on the environment to be reduced.</p>

In order to avoid inefficiencies and an unnecessary burden, the Stage IV compulsory EU type-approval date should be delayed by one year and the flexibility quantity increased appropriately.
