               <p>Article 88 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides for Europol to be governed by a regulation to be adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. It also requires the establishment of procedures for the scrutiny of Europol&apos;s activities by the European Parliament, together with national parliaments, subject to point (c) of Article 12 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Article 9 of Protocol No 1 on the role of National Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU (&apos;Protocol No 1&apos;), in order to enhance the democratic legitimacy and accountability of Europol to the Union&apos;s citizens. Therefore, Decision 2009/371/JHA should be replaced by a regulation laying down, inter alia, rules on parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

               <p>Large-scale criminal and terrorist networks pose a significant threat to the internal security of the Union and to the safety and livelihood of its citizens. Available threat assessments show that criminal groups are becoming increasingly poly-criminal and cross-border in their activities. National law enforcement authorities therefore need to cooperate more closely with their counterparts in other Member States. In this context, it is necessary to equip Europol to better support Member States in Union-wide crime prevention, analyses and investigations. This was also confirmed in the evaluation of Decision 2009/371/JHA.</p>

               <p>As serious crime often occurs across internal borders, Europol should support and strengthen Member States&apos; actions and their cooperation in preventing and combating serious crime affecting two or more Member States. Given that terrorism is one of the most significant threats to the security of the Union, Europol should assist Member States in facing common challenges in this regard. As the Union law enforcement agency, Europol should also support and strengthen actions and cooperation in tackling forms of crime that affect the interests of the Union. Among the forms of crime with which Europol is competent to deal, organised crime will continue to fall within the scope of Europol&apos;s main objectives, as, given its scale, significance and consequences, it also calls for a common approach by the Member States. Europol should also offer support in preventing and combating related criminal offences which are committed in order to procure the means of perpetrating acts in respect of which Europol is competent or to facilitate or perpetrate such acts or to ensure the impunity of committing them.</p>

Member States should also endeavour to provide Europol with a copy of bilateral and multilateral exchanges of information with other Member States on crime falling within Europol&apos;s objectives. When supplying Europol with the necessary information, Member States should also include information about any alleged cyber attacks affecting Union bodies located in their territory. At the same time, Europol should increase the level of its support to Member States, so as to enhance mutual cooperation and the sharing of information.

Therefore, Europol should be able to process data provided to it by Member States, Union bodies, third countries, international organisations and, under stringent conditions laid down by this Regulation, private parties, as well as data coming from publicly available sources, in order to develop an understanding of criminal phenomena and trends, to gather information about criminal networks, and to detect links between different criminal offences.</p>

Europol should be able to swiftly detect links between investigations and common modi operandi across different criminal groups, to check cross-matches of data and to have a clear overview of trends, while guaranteeing a high level of protection of personal data for individuals. Therefore, Europol databases should be structured in such a way as to allow Europol to choose the most efficient IT structure. Europol should also be able to act as a service provider, in particular by providing a secure network for the exchange of data, such as the secure information exchange network application (SIENA), aimed at facilitating the exchange of information between Member States, Europol, other Union bodies, third countries and international organisations. In order to ensure a high level of data protection, the purpose of processing operations and access rights as well as specific additional safeguards should be laid down.

Purpose limitation is a fundamental principle of personal data processing; in particular, it contributes to transparency, legal certainty and predictability and is particularly of high importance in the area of law enforcement cooperation, where data subjects are usually unaware when their personal data are being collected and processed and where the use of personal data may have a very significant impact on the lives and freedoms of individuals.</p>

               <p>To enhance operational cooperation between the agencies, and particularly to establish links between data already in the possession of the different agencies, Europol should enable Eurojust and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to have access, on the basis of a hit/no hit system, to data available at Europol. Europol and Eurojust should be able to conclude a working arrangement ensuring, in a reciprocal manner within their respective mandates, access to, and the possibility of searching, all information that has been provided for the purpose of cross-checking in accordance with specific safeguards and data protection guarantees provided for in this Regulation. Any access to data available at Europol should, by technical means, be limited to information falling within the respective mandates of those Union bodies.</p>

To enhance transparency, Europol should make publicly available a document setting out in an intelligible form the applicable provisions regarding the processing of personal data and the means available to data subjects to exercise their rights. Europol should also publish on its website a list of adequacy decisions, agreements and administrative arrangements relating to the transfer of personal data to third countries and international organisations.
