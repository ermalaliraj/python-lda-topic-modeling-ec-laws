               <p>For cymoxanil and phosphines and phosphides, maximum residue levels (MRLs) were set in Part A of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. For hydrogen phosphide MRLs were set in Annex II and Part B of Annex III to that Regulation. For sodium 5-nitroguaiacolate, sodium o-nitrophenolate and sodium p-nitrophenolate no MRLs are set in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, and as those active substances are not included in Annex IV to that Regulation, the default value of 0,01 mg/kg laid down in Article 18(1)(b) of that Regulation applies.</p>

               <p>For cymoxanil, the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter &apos;the Authority&apos;, submitted a reasoned opinion on the existing MRLs in accordance with Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">

It recommended lowering the MRLs for potatoes, garlic, onions, cucumbers, gherkins, courgettes, broccoli, cauliflower, peas (fresh, with pods), globe artichokes and leek. For other products it recommended raising or keeping the existing MRLs. It concluded that concerning the MRLs for table grapes, wine grapes, lettuce, spinach, beans (dry), lentils (dry), peas (dry), lupines (dry), herbal infusions (dried, flowers) and hops some information was not available and that further consideration by risk managers was required. As there is no risk for consumers, the MRLs for those products should be set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 at the existing level or the level identified by the Authority. These MRLs will be reviewed; the review will take into account the information available within two years from the publication of this Regulation. The Authority concluded that concerning the MRLs for sunflower seed and soya bean no information was available and that further consideration by risk managers was required. The MRLs for these products should be set at the specific limit of determination.</p>
