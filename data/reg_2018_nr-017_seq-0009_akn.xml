               <p>For that purpose, a program for the re-evaluation of food additives is laid down in the Commission Regulation (EU) No 257/2010<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">
                     <p>Commission Regulation (EU) No 257/2010 of 25 March 2010 setting up the program for the re-evaluation of approved food additives in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on food additives (OJ L 80, 26.3.2010, p. 19).</p>

               <p>On 30 June 2015 the Authority delivered a Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of sorbic acid (E 200), potassium sorbate (E 202) and calcium sorbate (E 203) as food additives<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">
                     <p>
                        <i>EFSA Journal</i> 2015;13(6):4144.</p>
                  </authorialNote>. The opinion stated that there was a lack of genotoxicity data on calcium sorbate. Consequently the Authority was not able to confirm the safety of calcium sorbate as a food additive and concluded that it should be excluded from the group Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) defined for sorbic acid (E 200) and potassium sorbate (E 202). The opinion stated that genotoxicity studies on calcium sorbate need to be performed in order to consider including calcium sorbate in that group ADI.</p>

               <p>On 10 June 2016 the Commission launched a public call for scientific and technological data on sorbic acid (E 200), potassium sorbate (E 202) and calcium sorbate (E 203)<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">
                     <p>http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_improvement_agents/additives/re-evaluation_en</p>
                  </authorialNote>, targeting the data needs identified in the Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of those substances as food additives. However, no business operator committed to providing the requested genotoxicity data for calcium sorbate (E 203). Without those data the Authority cannot complete the re-evaluation of the safety of calcium sorbate as a food additive and consequently it cannot be determined whether that substance still fulfils the conditions pursuant to Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 for inclusion in the Union list of approved food additives.</p>
