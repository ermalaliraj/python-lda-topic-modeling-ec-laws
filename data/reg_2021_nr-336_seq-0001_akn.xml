                     <p>Regulation (EU) 2021/840 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2021 establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting for the period 2021-2027 (the &apos;Pericles IV programme&apos;), and repealing Regulation (EU) No 331/2014 (OJ L 186, 27.5.2021, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote> establishes an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the &apos;Pericles IV programme&apos;) that is applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties. Article 139 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that measures governing the use of the euro referred to in Article 133 thereof shall not apply to the Member States with a derogation.</p>

               <p>The exchange of information and staff and the assistance and training measures implemented under the Pericles IV programme should however be uniform throughout the Union. The requisite measures should therefore be taken to ensure the same level of protection for the euro in the Member States that do not have the euro as their official currency.</p>
