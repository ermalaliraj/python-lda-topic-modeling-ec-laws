                     <p>Council Directive 89/686/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment (OJ L 399, 30.12.1989, p. 18).</p>
                  </authorialNote> was adopted in the context of establishing the internal market, in order to harmonise health and safety requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE) in all Member States and to remove obstacles to trade in PPE between Member States.</p>

               <p>Directive 89/686/EEC is based on the &apos;new approach&apos; principles, as set out in the Council Resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical harmonisation and standards<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">
                     <p>OJ C 136, 4.6.1985, p. 1.</p>
                  </authorialNote>. Thus, it sets only the essential requirements applying to PPE, whereas technical details are adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cenelec) in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">
                     <p>Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC(52), 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC, 2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Decision 87/95/EEC and Decision No 1673/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 316, 14.11.2012, p. 12).</p>
                  </authorialNote>. Conformity with the harmonised standards so set, the reference numbers of which are published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>, provides a presumption of conformity with the requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC. Experience has shown that those basic principles have worked well in that sector and should be maintained and even further promoted.</p>

               <p>Experience with the application of Directive 89/686/EEC has shown inadequacies and inconsistencies in the product coverage and conformity assessment procedures. In order to take account of that experience and to provide clarification in relation to the framework within which products covered by this Regulation may be made available on the market, certain aspects of Directive 89/686/EEC should be revised and enhanced.</p>

               <p>Since the scope, the essential health and safety requirements and conformity assessment procedures have to be identical in all the Member States there is almost no flexibility in transposing a directive based on the new approach principles into national law. Directive 89/686/EEC should therefore be replaced by a regulation, which is the appropriate legal instrument for imposing clear and detailed rules which do not give room for divergent transposition by Member States.</p>

Therefore, certain definitions, the general obligations of economic operators, the presumption of conformity, EU declaration of conformity, rules on CE marking, requirements for conformity assessment bodies and notification procedures, the conformity assessment procedures and the provisions concerning procedures to deal with PPE presenting a risk should be adapted to that Decision.</p>

               <p>Some products on the market that provide a protective function to the user are excluded from the scope of Directive 89/686/EEC. In order to ensure as high a level of protection for the user of those products as for the user of PPE covered by Directive 89/686/EEC, the scope of this Regulation should include PPE for private use against heat, in line with similar PPE for professional use which is already covered by Directive 89/686/EEC. Artisanal decorative products do not claim to fulfil a protective function, are by definition not personal protective equipment and are therefore not concerned by that inclusion. Clothing intended for private use with reflective or fluorescent elements included for reasons of design or decoration is not personal protective equipment and is therefore not covered by this Regulation. As for products intended for private use to protect against atmospheric conditions that are not of an extreme nature or to protect against damp and water, including but not limited to seasonal clothing, umbrellas and dishwashing gloves, those should also fall outside of the scope of this Regulation. It is also appropriate to clarify the list of excluded PPE set out in Annex I to Directive 89/686/EEC by adding a reference to products covered by other legislation and therefore excluded from the scope of this Regulation.</p>

An efficient traceability system facilitates the market surveillance authorities&apos; task of tracing economic operators who made non-compliant PPE available on the market.

               <p>In order to simplify and adapt certain essential safety requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC to the current practice, the requirement to label PPE protecting against harmful noise with a comfort index should be removed as experience has shown that it is not possible to measure and establish such an index. As regards mechanical vibrations, it is appropriate to remove the requirement not to exceed the limit values set by Union legislation on the exposure of workers to vibrations since the use of PPE alone is not able to achieve this objective. As regards PPE protecting against radiation, it is no longer necessary to require that the instructions for use supplied by the manufacturer indicate transmission curves, since the indication of the protection factor is more useful and is sufficient for the user.</p>

               <p>Transparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in certificates of conformity, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying out that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the appropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national authorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the conformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory requirements.</p>

               <p>Conformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for the PPE to be placed on the market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks. Therefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the performance of bodies to be notified, and the monitoring of bodies already notified, cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries.</p>

               <p>In the interests of competitiveness, it is crucial that notified bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies.</p>
