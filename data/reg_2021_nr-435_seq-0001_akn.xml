               <p>The Commission communication of 29 November 2017 entitled &apos;The Future of Food and Farming&apos; sets out the challenges, objectives and orientations for the future common agricultural policy (CAP) after 2020. Those objectives include making the CAP more result-driven and market-oriented, boosting modernisation and sustainability, including the economic, social, environmental and climate sustainability of the agricultural, forestry and rural areas, and helping reduce the Union legislation-related administrative burden for beneficiaries.</p>

               <p>In order to address the global dimension and implications of the CAP, the Commission should ensure coherence with the Union external policies and instruments, in particular in development cooperation and trade. The Union&apos;s commitment to policy coherence for development requires the taking into account of development objectives and principles when designing policies.</p>

               <p>Since the CAP needs to sharpen its responses to the challenges and opportunities as they manifest themselves at international, Union, national, regional, local and farm levels, it is necessary to streamline the governance of the CAP and improve its delivery on the Union objectives and to significantly decrease the administrative burden. The CAP should be based on delivery of performance (&apos;the delivery model&apos;). Therefore, the Union should set the basic policy parameters, such as the objectives of the CAP and its basic requirements, while Member States should bear greater responsibility as to how they meet those objectives and achieve targets. Enhanced subsidiarity makes it possible to better take into account local conditions and needs and the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions, tailoring the support to maximise the contribution to the achievement of Union objectives.</p>

               <p>With a view to further improving the performance of the CAP, income support should be targeted towards active farmers. To ensure a common approach at Union level, a framework definition of &apos;active farmer&apos; displaying the essential elements should be set out. Member States should determine in their CAP Strategic Plans, on the basis of objective conditions, which farmers are considered to be active farmers. To reduce the administrative burden, Member States should be allowed to grant direct payments to smaller farmers who also contribute to the vitality of rural areas and to establish a negative list of non-agricultural activities compared to which the agricultural activities are typically marginal. The negative list should not be the only way in which the definition is determined but should be used as a complementary tool to help to identify such non-agricultural activities, without prejudice for the persons concerned to prove that they fulfil the criteria of the definition of &apos;active farmer&apos;. To ensure a better income, strengthen the socio-economic fabric of rural areas or pursue related objectives, the definition of &apos;active farmer&apos; should not preclude the granting of support to pluri-active or part-time farmers who in addition to farming are also engaged in non-agricultural activities.</p>

               <p>In the context of greater market orientation of the CAP, as outlined by the communication on &apos;The Future of Food and Farming&apos;, market exposure, climate change and associated frequency and severity of extreme weather events, as well as sanitary and phytosanitary crises, may lead to risks of price volatility and increasing pressures on incomes, in particular of primary producers.

               <p>Supporting and improving environmental protection and climate action and contributing to the achievement of Union&apos;s environmental and climate-related objectives is a very high priority in the future of Union agriculture and forestry. The CAP should play a role both in reducing negative impacts on the environment and climate, including biodiversity, and in increasing the provision of environmental public goods on all types of farmland and forest land (including high-nature-value areas) and in rural areas as a whole. The architecture of the CAP should therefore reflect greater ambition with respect to those objectives. It should include elements which support or otherwise induce a wide range of action in pursuit of the objectives within agriculture, food production, forestry and rural areas as a whole.</p>

               <p>The best combination of types of action for addressing those objectives will vary from one Member State to another. Concurrently with the need to increase efforts on adaptation to climate change, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and enhanced carbon sequestration are both important in mitigating climate change. Energy production and use supported through the CAP should concern energy which clearly displays the characteristics of sustainability, including as regards greenhouse gases. With regard to the management of natural resources, a lower dependence on chemicals such as artificial fertilisers and pesticides may be particularly helpful including for the protection of biodiversity, where lower dependence on pesticides and action to halt and reverse the decline of pollinator populations is needed in a timely manner in many parts of the Union.</p>

In order to implement the framework, Member States should set a national standard for each of the standards set at Union level, taking into account the specific characteristics of the area concerned, including soil and climatic conditions, existing farming conditions, farming practices, farm size and farm structures, land use, and the specificities of outermost regions. Member States should be able to set other national standards related to the main objectives of the GAEC standards in order to improve the environmental and climate delivery of the framework of the GAEC standards. Given the existing practices under organic farming system, no further requirement should be imposed on organic farmers as regards crop rotation. In addition, as regards the standards on crop rotation and on minimum share of arable land for biodiversity, Member States should be able to consider certain exceptions to avoid excessive burden on smaller farms or to exclude some farms that already fulfil the objective of the GAEC standards as they are covered to a significant extent by grassland, land lying fallow or leguminous crops.

               <p>To avoid the excessive administrative burden caused by managing numerous payments of small amounts and to ensure an effective contribution of the support to achieving the objectives of the CAP to which the direct payments contribute, Member States should set requirements in terms of minimum area or support-related minimum amount for receiving direct payments in their CAP Strategic Plans. When Member States decide to grant animal-related income support to be paid per animal, they should always set a threshold in terms of minimum amount to avoid penalising farmers who are eligible for this support, but whose area is below the threshold. Due to the very specific farming structure in the smaller Aegean islands, Greece should be able to decide whether any minimum threshold should apply in that area.</p>

In order to better target that support, it should be possible to differentiate the payment amounts by groups of territories, based on socio-economic or agronomic conditions, or to reduce them taking into account other interventions. With a view to avoiding disruptive effects for farmers&apos; income, Member States should be allowed to implement the basic income support for sustainability on the basis of payment entitlements. In that case, the value of payment entitlements before any further convergence should be proportional to their value as established under the basic payment schemes pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, taking into account the payments for agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment.

The CAP should continue to support the interactive innovation model, which enhances the collaboration between actors to make best use of complementary knowledge with a view to spreading solutions ready for practice. Farm advisory services should be strengthened within the AKIS. The CAP Strategic Plan should provide information on how advisors, researchers and the national CAP network will work together. Each Member State or region, as appropriate, in order to strengthen its AKIS and in line with its AKIS strategic approach should be able to fund a number of actions aimed at knowledge exchange and innovation, as well as facilitate the development by farmers of farm-level strategies to increase the resilience of their holdings, using the types of intervention developed in this Regulation. In addition, each Member State should establish a strategy for the development of digital technologies and for the use of those technologies to demonstrate how digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas will be boosted.</p>
