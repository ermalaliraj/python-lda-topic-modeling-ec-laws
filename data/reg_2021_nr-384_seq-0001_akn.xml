               <p>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) published its annual stock advice for Baltic stocks on 28 May 2021. It indicated that the biomass of the western Baltic herring in ICES subdivisions 20-24 was only 54 % of the limit reference point for spawning stock biomass (B<sub>lim</sub>), below which it is possible that reproductive capacity might be reduced. Furthermore, recruitment remains at historically low levels. ICES therefore published for the fourth consecutive year an advice for zero catches for western Baltic herring. Pursuant to Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1139, all appropriate remedial measures should therefore be adopted to ensure a rapid return of the stock concerned to levels above the level capable of producing MSY. Moreover, that provision requires further remedial measures to be adopted. If the fishing opportunities for western Baltic herring were set at the level indicated in the ICES advice, the obligation to land all catches in mixed fisheries with by-catches of western Baltic herring would lead to the phenomenon of &apos;choke species&apos;. In order to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, allowing fisheries for other stocks to continue in view of otherwise potentially severe socioeconomic implications and, on the other hand, the need to achieve a good biological status for the stock, taking into account the difficulty of fishing all stocks in a mixed fishery at MSY at the same time, it is appropriate to establish a specific TAC for by-catches of western Baltic herring. However, fishing operations conducted for the exclusive purpose of scientific investigations and in full compliance with the conditions set out in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1241 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">

               <p>As regards the eastern Baltic cod stock, since 2019 ICES has been able to base its precautionary advice on a more data-rich assessment. ICES estimates that the biomass of the eastern Baltic cod stock continues to be below B<sub>lim</sub> and has decreased further since 2020. ICES therefore published for the third consecutive year an advice for zero catches for eastern Baltic cod. Since 2019, strict conservation measures have been adopted in the Union. Pursuant to Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1139, the targeted fishery of eastern Baltic cod was closed and the TAC for unavoidable by-catches of eastern Baltic cod was set at a very low level to avoid the phenomenon of &apos;choke species&apos; in other fisheries. Moreover, further remedial measures functionally linked to the fishing opportunities were adopted in the form of spawning closures and the prohibition of recreational fisheries in the main distribution area. Given the ICES advice and the unchanged stock situation, it is appropriate to maintain unchanged the level of fishing opportunities and the functionally linked remedial measures.</p>

               <p>As regards western Baltic cod, scientific estimates have indicated for several years that the spawning stock biomass was below the reference point, below which specific and appropriate management action is to be taken (B<sub>trigger</sub>). Increasingly strict management measures have therefore been adopted in recent years. In 2021 ICES decided to perform a more in-depth assessment of the stock&apos;s situation and hence postponed its advice to 10 September 2021. That assessment revealed that the biomass of the western Baltic cod stock was less than half of the previous estimate and that for more than 10 years it has been mostly below B<sub>lim</sub>. The current biomass is estimated to be about half of B<sub>lim</sub>. Recruitment has been historically low since 2018. ICES estimates with a 53 % probability that the stock biomass could increase slightly above B<sub>lim</sub> in 2023 even with some catches. In such a situation, pursuant to Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1139, remedial measure should be taken and the fishing opportunities set in a way to ensure the rapid return of the stock to a level above the level capable of producing MSY. The level of advised catches is so low that it cannot sustain both a directed fishery and the unavoidable by-catches in other fisheries, in particular in demersal flatfish fisheries. Therefore, it is appropriate to set a TAC limited to unavoidable by-catches in other fisheries to avoid the phenomenon of &apos;choke species&apos;, with an exemption for fishing operations conducted for the exclusive purpose of scientific investigations and in full compliance with the conditions set out in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1241. Moreover, further remedial measures functionally linked to the fishing opportunities were previously adopted in the form of spawning closures and limitations on recreational fisheries. Given the further severe deterioration of the stock, it is appropriate to extend the spawning closure from 15 January to 31 March in order to cover the period during which cod aggregates before spawning. An additional exemption from the spawning closure should be introduced for fishing vessels fishing with dredges for bivalve molluscs in ICES subdivision 22 in waters of less than 20 metres depth, since those fisheries take place outside of the cod spawning grounds and have very low by-catches of cod. Regarding recreational fisheries, contrary to previous years ICES was not in a position to provide a split between commercial and recreational catches, because of the low level of total advised catches. Given the condition of the stock, it is necessary to decrease the bag limit to the minimum in order to remain within the catch levels advised by ICES. Moreover, it is appropriate to no longer exempt recreational fisheries from the spawning closure period.</p>

               <p>In 2020, ICES estimated that the biomass of the central Baltic herring had fallen below the spawning stock biomass reference point below which specific and appropriate management action is to be taken (B<sub>trigger</sub>). In 2021, ICES estimated that the biomass had fallen further and is now close to B<sub>lim</sub>. It is therefore appropriate to set the fishing opportunities in accordance with Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1139.</p>

               <p>According to ICES advice, cod is by-caught in plaice fisheries. Sprat is caught in a mixed fishery with herring and is a prey species for cod. It is appropriate to take those multispecies interactions into account when setting the fishing opportunities for plaice and sprat.</p>

               <p>Regarding salmon in ICES subdivisions 22-31, ICES had stated for several years previously that the status of the river stocks was very heterogeneous. In order to give experts more time to take that divergence better into account, ICES decided to postpone its advice to 15 September 2021. According to ICES advice, all commercial and recreational catches in the main basin, which are inherently mixed fisheries catching salmon from healthy and weak river stocks, should be stopped in order to protect the weak river stocks. ICES however considers that the existing directed fishery in the coastal areas of the Gulf of Bothnia and the Aland Sea could continue during the salmon summer migration. In order to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, allowing fisheries to continue in view of otherwise potentially severe socioeconomic implications and, on the other hand, the need to achieve a good biological status for the stock, taking into account the difficulty of fishing all stocks in a mixed fishery at MSY at the same time, it is appropriate to establish a specific TAC for by-catches of salmon in those areas, with the exemption of fishing operations conducted for the exclusive purpose of scientific investigations and in full compliance with the conditions set out in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1241, and of coastal fisheries north of latitude 59°30′N during the period from 1 May to 31 August. Given the ICES advice, it is appropriate to adopt further remedial measures functionally linked to the fishing opportunities. The use of longlines beyond four nautical miles should be prohibited since this is typically a gear used to target salmon. Moreover, in those areas where commercial fisheries are not allowed it should be allowed to retain only one fin-clipped salmon per angler per day in recreational fisheries. Finally, to avoid misreporting, all specimens of any fish species retained should be landed whole to be able to unequivocally identify them.</p>

               <p>The introduction of a prohibition of fishing for sea trout beyond four nautical miles and of a limitation of by-catches of sea trout to 3 % of the combined catch of sea trout and salmon has contributed to a large extent to substantially reducing previously significant misreporting of catches in the salmon fishery, in particular as sea trout catches.

More recently, the year-to-year flexibility mechanism was introduced by Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 for all stocks that are subject to the landing obligation. Therefore, to avoid excessive flexibility that would undermine the principle of rational and responsible exploitation of living marine biological resources, hinder the achievement of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy and cause the biological status of the stocks to deteriorate, it should be established that Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 apply to analytical TACs only where the year-to-year flexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is not used.</p>

Regulation (EU) 2021/92 includes the fishing opportunities table for mackerel in Norwegian waters of 2a and 4a and it should be possible to fish the quota of 13359 tonnes allocated to Denmark in Union and United Kingdom waters of the North Sea. A footnote should be inserted in the relevant fishing opportunities table to allow Denmark to fish that quota in Union and United Kingdom waters of the North Sea. The United Kingdom has been consulted on that possibility and raised no objection to the approach allowing that quota to be fished in those United Kingdom waters as of 12 October 2021.</p>

               <p>The Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union, of the one part, and the Government of Greenland and the Government of Denmark, of the other part, and the implementing Protocol thereto<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="8">

                  </authorialNote>, provide that the Union is to receive 7,7 % of the TAC for capelin to be fished in Greenland waters of ICES subareas 5 and 14. On 5 October 2021, the Union received information from the Greenland authorities that ICES has issued an advice for capelin for the 2021/2022 season at the level of 904200 tonnes as TAC. Following scientific advice and based on the agreement reached between Greenland, Iceland and Norway on capelin, the Government of Greenland has fixed a quota of 135630 tonnes. In accordance with the implementing Protocol, Greenland would like to offer the Union 69623 tonnes of capelin, which equals to 7,7 % of the total TAC. That TAC should now be set on that basis. Furthermore, Greenland, Iceland and Norway agreed, as part of their framework arrangement on the conservation and management of capelin, on new fishing season arrangements. Therefore, it is also necessary to reflect the change in the fishing season, which should now refer to a period from 15 October 2021 to 15 April 2022.</p>

               <p>To avoid the interruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihoods of Union fishermen, the provisions of this Regulation concerning the Baltic Sea should apply from 1 January 2022. The catch limits provided for in Regulation (EU) 2021/92 apply from 1 January 2021. The provisions introduced by this Regulation concerning those catch limits should therefore also apply from 1 January 2021. However, this Regulation should apply to Norway pout in ICES division 3a, United Kingdom and Union waters of ICES subarea 4 and United Kingdom waters in ICES division 2a from 1 November 2021 until 31 October 2022. In view of the need to continue sustainable fishing activities and to start the relevant fisheries on time for the opening of the fishing seasons, the provisions of this Regulation concerning catch limits for mackerel in Norwegian waters of the North Sea and capelin in Greenland waters of ICES subareas 5 and 14 should apply from 12 October 2021 and 15 October 2021 respectively. Since the fishing opportunities concerned either have not yet been exhausted or will be increased by this Regulation, the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations are not affected by the retroactive application of this Regulation. For reasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication,</p>
