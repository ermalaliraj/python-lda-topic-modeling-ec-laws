               <p>The Schengen Information System (SIS) constitutes an essential tool for the application of the provisions of the Schengen <i>acquis</i> as integrated into the framework of the European Union. SIS is one of the major compensatory measures contributing to maintaining a high level of security within the area of freedom, security and justice of the Union by supporting operational cooperation between national competent authorities, in particular border guards, the police, customs authorities, immigration authorities, and authorities responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences or execution of criminal penalties.</p>

               <p>The fact that the legal basis for SIS consists of separate instruments does not affect the principle that SIS constitutes one single information system that should operate as such. It should include a single network of national offices called SIRENE Bureaux for ensuring the exchange of supplementary information.

It is also necessary to determine the categories of data to be entered into the system, the purposes for which the data are to be entered and processed and the criteria for their entry.

               <p>SIS includes a central system (Central SIS) and national systems. The national systems might contain a complete or partial copy of the SIS database, which may be shared by two or more Member States. Considering that SIS is the most important information exchange instrument in Europe for ensuring security and effective border management, it is necessary to ensure its uninterrupted operation at central as well as at national level. The availability of SIS should be subject to close monitoring at central and Member State level and any incident of unavailability for end-users should be registered and reported to stakeholders at national and Union level. Each Member State should set up a backup for its national system. Member States should also ensure uninterrupted connectivity with Central SIS by having duplicated and physically and geographically separated connection points. Central SIS and the Communication Infrastructure should be operated in such a way that their functioning 24 hours a day, 7 days a week is ensured. For that reason the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (&apos;eu-LISA&apos;), established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1726 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="8">

The Commission should report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the data quality issues encountered.

Therefore, it should be possible to upload the dactyloscopic data of an unknown perpetrator into SIS, provided that the owner of that data can be identified with a very high degree of probability as the perpetrator of a serious crime or act of terrorism. This is in particular the case if dactyloscopic data are found on the weapon or on any object used for the offence. The mere presence of the dactyloscopic data at the crime scene should not be considered as indicating a very high degree of probability that the dactyloscopic data are those of the perpetrator. A further precondition for the creation of such an alert should be that the identity of the suspect cannot be established on the basis of data from any other relevant national, Union or international database. Should a dactyloscopic data search lead to a potential match, the Member State should carry out further checks with the involvement of experts to establish whether the suspect is the owner of the prints stored in SIS, and should establish the identity of the person. The procedure should be subject to national law. Such identification could substantially contribute to the investigation and could lead to an arrest provided that all the conditions for an arrest are met.</p>

               <p>Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="18">
                     <p>Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 September 2016 on the European Border and Coast Guard and amending Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Regulation (EC) No 863/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 and Council Decision 2005/267/EC (OJ L 251, 16.9.2016, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote> provides for the purpose of that Regulation, that the host Member State is to authorise the members of the teams referred to in point (8) of Article 2 of that Regulation, deployed by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency to consult Union databases where this consultation is necessary for fulfilling operational aims specified in the operational plan on border checks, border surveillance and return. Other relevant Union agencies, in particular the European Asylum Support Office and Europol, may also deploy experts who are not members of the staff of those Union agencies as part of migration management support teams. The objective of the deployment of the teams referred to in points (8) and (9) of Article 2 of that Regulation is to provide technical and operational reinforcement to the requesting Member States, especially to those facing disproportionate migratory challenges. For the teams referred to in points (8) and (9) of Article 2 of that Regulation to fulfil their tasks, they require access to SIS through a technical interface of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency connecting to Central SIS. In cases where searches in SIS carried out by the teams referred to in points (8) and (9) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 or by the teams of staff reveal the existence of an alert entered by a Member State, the member of the team or the staff cannot take the required action unless authorised to do so by the host Member State. Therefore, the host Member State should be informed to allow it to follow up the case. The host Member State should notify the issuing Member State of the hit through the exchange of supplementary information.</p>

               <p>Certain aspects of SIS cannot be covered exhaustively by this Regulation given their technical, highly detailed and frequently changing nature. Those aspects include, for example, technical rules on entering data, on updating, deleting and searching data and on data quality and rules related to biometric data rules on the compatibility and order of priority of alerts, on links between alerts, setting the expiry date of alerts within the maximum time limit and on the exchange of supplementary information. Implementing powers in respect of those aspects should therefore be conferred on the Commission. Technical rules on searching alerts should take into account the smooth operation of national applications.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure the smooth functioning of SIS, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of new sub-categories of objects to be sought under alerts on objects for seizure or used as evidence in criminal proceedings, and the determination of the circumstances in which photographs and facial images may be used for the identification of persons other than in the context of regular border crossing points. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="20">

This Regulation should apply in its entirety within three years after its entry into force. In order to avoid delays in its application the phased implementation of this Regulation should be closely monitored.</p>
