               <p>There are certain stocks for which the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES), while assessing them against MSY, has issued scientific advice for no catches. If TACs for those stocks were established at the level indicated in such scientific advice, the obligation to land all catches both in the Union and UK waters, including by-catches from those stocks, in mixed fisheries, would lead to the phenomenon of &apos;choke species&apos;. In order to balance the need for continuation of those mixed fisheries in view of the potentially severe socio-economic implications on complete interruption of those fisheries with the need to achieve a good biological status for those stocks, and taking into account the difficulty of fishing all stocks in a mixed fishery at MSY at the same time, the Union and the UK agreed that it is appropriate to establish specific TACs for by-catches for those stocks. The level of those TACs should be such that mortality for those stocks is decreased and that it provides incentives for improvements in selectivity and avoidance. The levels of the fishing opportunities for those stocks should be established in line with the written record in order both to ensure a level playing field for Union operators as well as to provide for the significant recovery of the biomass of those stocks at the same time.</p>

               <p>As regards the fishing opportunities around the area of Svalbard, the Treaty of 9 February 1920 relating to Spitsbergen (Svalbard) (&apos;the 1920 Treaty of Paris&apos;) grants equal and non-discriminatory access to resources for all Parties to that Treaty, including with respect to fishing. The view of the Union concerning that access has been set out on numerous occasions, most recently in the <i>notes verbales</i> to Norway No 02/21 dated 26 February 2021 and No 08/21 dated 28 June 2021. In order to ensure that the exploitation of resources within the area of Svalbard is consistent with such non-discriminatory management rules as may be set out by Norway, which enjoys sovereignty and jurisdiction in the area within the limits of that Treaty, the Council fixed, for ICES subarea 1 and division 2b, the number of vessels that are authorised to conduct fishery for snow crab and quotas for cod. The allocation of such fishing opportunities among Member States is applicable until 31 December 2021. In the <i>note verbale</i> to Norway No 02/21 dated 26 February 2021, the Union reserved its rights to take all appropriate remedial countermeasures to safeguard legitimate rights and interests of the Union. It is also appropriate to recall that in the Union, primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with applicable law lies with the flag Member States.</p>

               <p>The catch limits provided for in Regulations (EU) 2019/1919 and (EU) 2021/91 apply as from 1 January 2021. The provisions introduced by this Regulation concerning catch limits should therefore also apply from that date, with the exception of the provisions concerning anchovy in ICES subareas 9 and 10 and in Union waters of CECAF 34.1.1, which should apply as from 1 July 2021, and of Article 3(2) point (c), as regards new paragraphs 2a and 2b of Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2021/92, which should apply as from 1 August 2021. The catch limits provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/1919 apply for the second period of application of the extension of the Protocol, namely from 16 November 2020. The UK has not made use of those fishing opportunities and is no longer entitled to do so as of 1 January 2021. The amendment of those fishing opportunities under that Regulation should therefore apply from 1 January 2021. Such retroactive application does not affect the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations, as the fishing opportunities concerned are increased or have not yet been exhausted. For reasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication,</p>
