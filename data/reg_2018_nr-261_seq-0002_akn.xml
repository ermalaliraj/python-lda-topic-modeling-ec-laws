The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: &apos;The combination of opuntia fruit dry extract standardised in quercetin and betalain, N-acetyl cysteine, zinc, vitamin B3, E, B6, B2, B9 and B12 in Condensyl速 decreases sperm DNA damage (sperm nuclear decondensation index and DNA fragmentation index).

               <p>On 5 May 2017, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority, which concluded that on the basis of the data presented a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of Condensyl速 and the reduction of sperm DNA damage in the context of reducing the risk of male infertility. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.</p>
