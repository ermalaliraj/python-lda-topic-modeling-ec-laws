               <p>The Union list of flavourings and source materials contains a number of substances for which the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has not completed the evaluation or it has requested additional scientific data to be provided for completion of the evaluation.

Therefore, these flavouring substances should be removed from the Union list.</p>
