                     <p>Commission Regulation (EU) No 579/2014 of 28 May 2014 granting derogation from certain provisions of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the transport of liquid oils and fats by sea (OJ L 160, 29.5.2014, p. 14).</p>
                  </authorialNote> provides for a derogation from point 4 of Chapter IV of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 as regards the transport on seagoing vessels of liquid oils and fats (&apos;oils or fats&apos;) intended for or likely to be used for human consumption under certain conditions.</p>

            <recital xml:id="rec_d741e94">
               <num>(2)</num>
               <p>Those conditions relate to the shipping equipment and practices as well as to criteria as regards substances to be transported in a seagoing vessel as previous cargo. Substances that fulfil those criteria are listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 579/2014 (list of acceptable previous cargoes).</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d741e100">
               <num>(3)</num>
               <p>In the list of acceptable previous cargoes, the combined entry for &apos;ammonium nitrate solution and calcium nitrate (CN-9) solution and their double salt&apos; does not adequately describe the cargo which causes confusion to ship charterers. Therefore, the list of acceptable previous cargoes should be amended to reflect the other forms that calcium nitrate contains such as calcium ammonium nitrate, calcium (II) nitrate dehydrate and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate. All these forms have identical hazard profiles and only differ in the amount of crystal water that the molecules contain.</p>

                     <p>Minutes of the 68th plenary meeting of the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (EFSA/CONTAM/2330) available at http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/events/event/141125b-m.pdf</p>
                  </authorialNote> confirmed that these various forms of calcium nitrate solutions differ only in the hydration number and concluded that their presence has no impact in the toxicological properties and chemical reactivity as compared to the substances originally listed in the combined entry.</p>
