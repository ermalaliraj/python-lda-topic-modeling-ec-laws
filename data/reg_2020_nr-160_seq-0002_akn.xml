               <p>On 30 September 2014, the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (&apos;the CONTAM Panel&apos;) of the European Food Safety Authority (&apos;the Authority&apos;) adopted a scientific opinion on the risks to public health related to the presence of perchlorate in food<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">

                  </authorialNote>. The CONTAM Panel established a tolerable daily intake of 0,3 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day, based on the inhibition of thyroid iodine uptake in healthy adults. The CONTAM Panel concluded that the current estimated chronic dietary exposure to perchlorate is of potential concern, in particular for the high consumers in the younger age groups of the population with mild to moderate iodine deficiency. Furthermore, it is possible that current estimated short-term exposure to perchlorate is of concern for breast-fed infants and small children with low iodine intake.</p>

Given the previously established tolerable daily intake of 0,3 Î¼g/kg bw per day, the CONTAM Panel confirmed the conclusion that the current chronic and short-term exposure to perchlorate may pose a possible concern for human health.</p>

               <p>It is therefore appropriate to set maximum levels of perchlorate both in foodstuffs which contain significant levels of perchlorate and which contribute significantly to human exposure and in foodstuffs which are of relevance as regards the possible exposure of vulnerable groups of the population such as infants and young children.</p>
