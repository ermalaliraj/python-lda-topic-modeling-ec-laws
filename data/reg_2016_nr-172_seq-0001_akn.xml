As there is no risk for consumers, the MRLs for those products should be set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 at the existing level or the level identified by the Authority. These MRLs will be reviewed; the review will take into account the information available within two years from the publication of this Regulation. The Authority concluded that concerning the MRLs for oranges, lemons, mandarins, cherries, peaches, plums, grapes, strawberries, raspberries, table olives, kiwi, potatoes, peppers, cucumbers, courgettes, melons, watermelons, spinach, beans (fresh, with pods), beans (fresh, without pods), peas (fresh, with pods), peas (fresh, without pods), asparagus, celery, globe artichoke, beans (dry), chicory roots no information was available and that further consideration by risk managers was required.

                  </authorialNote>. It proposed to change the residue definition. It recommended lowering the MRL for sugar beet root. For other products it recommended keeping the existing MRL. It concluded that concerning the MRLs for lamb&apos;s lettuce, lettuce, scarole, cress, land cress, rocket, red mustard, purslane, asparagus, cardoons, celery, fennel, globe artichokes, leek, rhubarb, herbal infusions (dried, flowers), herbal infusions (dried, leaves), spices (bark), spices (buds) and spices (flower stigma) no information was available and that further consideration by risk managers was required. The authority indicated that a potential for accumulation of chloridazon residues in certain crops grown in rotation is expected and calculated MRLs for the products concerned which take into account that potential for accumulation after different plant back intervals and left it to risk managers to choose the required option. For the products concerned, for which the active substance is not to be used, residues inevitably result from soils where the active substance was previously used for other crops. As there is no risk for consumers, MRLs should be set for the products concerned in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 at the level identified by the Authority. The authority concluded that concerning the MRLs for beetroot, horseradish, garlic, onions, shallots, leaves and sprouts of brassica, spinach, beet leaves (chard), herbs, swine muscle, fat, liver and kidney, bovine muscle, fat, liver and kidney, sheep muscle, fat, liver and kidney, goat muscle, fat, liver and kidney, cattle, sheep and goat milk some information was not available and that further consideration by risk managers was required.

For other products it recommended raising or keeping the existing MRLs. It identified concerning the MRLs for tomatoes, peppers, head cabbage and fresh beans without pods a risk for consumers. It is therefore appropriate to lower these MRLs. It concluded that concerning the MRLs for strawberries, carrots, herbal infusions (dried flowers, leaves and roots), hops, spices (seeds, fruits and berries and roots and rhizome), swine muscle, fat, liver and kidney, bovine muscle, fat, liver and kidney, sheep muscle, fat, liver and kidney, goat muscle, fat, liver and kidney, poultry muscle, fat and liver, cattle, sheep and goat milk and birds&apos; eggs some information was not available and that further consideration by risk managers was required.

These MRLs will be reviewed; the review will take into account the information available within two years from the publication of this Regulation. The Authority concluded that concerning the MRLs for spring onions, leek and cotton seed no information was available, and that further consideration by risk managers was required.
