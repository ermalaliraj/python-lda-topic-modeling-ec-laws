The added value of those programmes, including as regards the protection of the financial and economic interests of the Member States and of the taxpayer, has been recognised by the tax authorities of the participating countries. The challenges for the next decade can only be tackled if Member States look beyond the borders of their administrative territories and cooperate intensively with their counterparts.</p>

               <p>The Fiscalis 2020 programme offers Member States a Union framework within which to develop cooperation activities. That framework is more cost-effective than if each Member State were to set up individual cooperation frameworks on a bilateral or multilateral basis. It is therefore appropriate to ensure the continuation of the Fiscalis 2020 programme by establishing a new programme in the same area, the Fiscalis programme (the &apos;Programme&apos;).</p>

               <p>The actions under the Fiscalis 2020 programme have proven to be adequate and should therefore be maintained. In order to provide more simplicity and flexibility in the execution of the Programme and thereby better deliver on its objectives, the actions should be defined only in terms of overall categories, with a list of illustrative examples of concrete activities, such as meetings and similar ad hoc events, including, where appropriate, presence in administrative offices and participation in administrative enquiries, project-based structured collaboration, including, where appropriate, joint audits, and IT capacity building, including, where appropriate, access by tax authorities to interconnected registers. Where appropriate, actions should also aim to address priority topics in order to fulfil the objectives of the Programme. Through cooperation and capacity building, the Programme should also promote and support the uptake and leverage of innovation to further improve the capabilities to deliver on the core priorities of taxation.</p>

               <p>Given the increasing mobility of taxpayers, the number of cross-border transactions, the internationalisation of financial instruments and the resulting increased risk of tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning, all of which go well beyond Union borders, adaptations of or extensions to European electronic systems for cooperation with third countries not associated with the Programme and international organisations could be of interest to the Union or to Member States. In particular, such adaptations or extensions would avoid the administrative burden and the costs inherent in developing and operating two similar electronic systems for Union and international exchanges of information. Therefore, when duly justified by that interest, such adaptations or extensions should be eligible for funding under the Programme.</p>

               <p>Considering the importance of globalisation and the importance of combating tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning, the Programme should provide for the possibility of involving external experts within the meaning of Article 238 of the Financial Regulation. Such external experts should mainly be representatives of governmental authorities, including governmental authorities of non-associated third countries, including least developed countries, as well as representatives of international organisations, of economic operators, of taxpayers and of civil society. In that context, a least developed country should be understood to mean a third country or non-EU territory that is eligible to receive official development assistance in accordance with the relevant list made publicly available by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and based on the United Nations&apos; definition of least developed countries. The selection of experts in expert groups should be based on the Commission decision of 30 May 2016 establishing horizontal rules on the creation and operation of Commission expert groups. As regards experts appointed in their personal capacity for acting independently in the public interest, the Commission should ensure that those experts are impartial, that they have no possible conflicts of interest with their professional responsibilities and that information about their selection and participation is publicly available.</p>

The interim and final evaluations should also address the remaining obstacles to the achievement of the Programme&apos;s objectives and make suggestions for best practices. In addition to the interim and final evaluations, as part of the performance reporting system, annual progress reports should be issued to monitor the progress made.

In accordance with the Financial Regulation, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the financial interests of the Union, grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and, in respect of those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the EPPO, and ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.</p>

               <p>Horizontal financial rules adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of Article 322 TFEU apply to this Regulation. Those rules are laid down in the Financial Regulation and determine in particular the procedure for establishing and implementing the budget through grants, procurement, prizes and indirect implementation, and provide for checks on the responsibility of financial actors. Rules adopted on the basis of Article 322 TFEU also include a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget.</p>

               <p>The types of financing and the methods of implementation under this Regulation should be chosen on the basis of their ability to achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the cost of controls, the administrative burden, and the expected risk of non-compliance. That choice should include the consideration of the use of lump sums, flat-rate financing and unit costs, as well as financing not linked to costs as referred to in Article 125(1) of the Financial Regulation. The eligible costs should be determined by reference to the nature of the eligible actions. The coverage of travel, accommodation and subsistence costs for participants in meetings and similar ad hoc events and the coverage of costs linked to the organisation of events is of utmost importance in order to ensure the participation of national experts and tax authorities in joint actions.</p>

               <p>In accordance with Article 193(2) of the Financial Regulation, a grant may be awarded for an action which has already begun, provided that the applicant can demonstrate the need for starting the action prior to signature of the grant agreement. However, the costs incurred prior to the date of submission of the grant application are not eligible, except in duly justified exceptional cases. In order to avoid any disruption in Union support which could be prejudicial to Union&apos;s interests, it should be possible to provide in the financing decision, during a limited period of time at the beginning of the multi-annual financial framework 2021-2027, and only in duly justified cases, for eligibility of activities and costs from the beginning of the 2021 financial year, even if they were implemented and incurred before the grant application was submitted.</p>
