               <p>In its 2016 roadmap to enhance information exchange and information management and in its conclusions of 8 June 2017 on the way forward to improve information exchange and ensure the interoperability of EU information systems, the Council invited the Commission to undertake a feasibility study for the establishment of a central EU repository containing information on long-stay visas and residence permits. On that basis, the Commission conducted two studies which concluded that developing a repository would be technically feasible and that re-using the VIS structure would be the best technical option, and that it would be necessary and proportionate to extend the scope of the VIS to include information on long-stay visas and residence permits.</p>

               <p>In its communication of 27 September 2017 entitled &apos;Delivery of the European Agenda on Migration&apos;, the Commission stated that the Union&apos;s common visa policy is not only an essential tool for facilitating tourism and business, but also a key tool to prevent security risks and risks of irregular migration to the Union. In that communication, the Commission acknowledged the need to further adapt the common visa policy to current challenges, taking into account new IT solutions and balancing the benefits of facilitated visa travel with improved migration, security and border management. It stated in that communication that the VIS legal framework would be revised, with the aim of further improving visa processing, including as regards data protection related aspects and access for law enforcement authorities, further expanding the use of the VIS for new categories and uses of data and to make full use of the interoperability instruments.</p>

                     <p>Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders (OJ L 239, 22.9.2000, p. 19).</p>
                  </authorialNote> (Schengen Convention) provides holders of valid residence permits or long-stay visas with a right to free movement within the territory of the contracting parties to the Agreement for a period of not more than 90 days in any 180 days, by instituting the mutual recognition of the residence permits and long-stay visas issued by those contracting parties. There are currently no means of checking whether applicants for or holders of such residence permits and long-stay visas could pose a threat to the security of the Member States other than the Member State processing the application for a long-stay visa or residence permit. In order to address the existing information gap, information on applicants for and holders of long-stay visas and residence permits should be stored in the VIS. As regards those documents, the purpose of the VIS should be to support a high level of security, which is particularly important for the Schengen area as an area without internal border controls, by contributing to the assessment of whether an applicant is considered to pose a threat to public policy, internal security or public health. It should also aim to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of checks at the external borders and of checks within the territory of the Member States carried out in accordance with Union or national law. The VIS should also assist in the identification, in particular in order to facilitate the return of any person who does not or no longer fulfils the conditions for entry to, stay or residence on the territory of the Member States. It should also contribute to the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences; ensure the correct identification of persons; facilitate the application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 and of Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="9">

               <p>Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 should also lay down the architecture of the VIS. The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) should be responsible for the technical development and operational management of the VIS and its components. Where eu-LISA cooperates with external contractors in any VIS-related tasks, it should closely monitor the activities of the contractor to ensure compliance with Regulation (EC) No 767/2008, in particular provisions on security, confidentiality and data protection. The operational management of the VIS should not be entrusted to private companies or private organisations.</p>

               <p>When adopting Regulation (EC) No 810/2009, it was recognised that the issue of the sufficient reliability of fingerprints of children below the age of 12 for identification and verification purposes and, in particular, how fingerprints evolve with age, would have to be addressed at a later stage on the basis of the results of a study that was to be carried out under the responsibility of the Commission. A study entitled &quot;Fingerprint Recognition for Children&quot;, which was carried out in 2013 by the Joint Research Centre, concluded that fingerprint recognition of children aged between six and 12 years is achievable with a satisfactory level of accuracy under certain conditions. A second study entitled &quot;Automatic fingerprint recognition: from children to elderly&quot; confirmed that finding in December 2017 and provided further insight into the effect of aging on fingerprint quality. On that basis, in 2017 the Commission conducted a further study entitled &quot;Feasibility and implications of lowering the fingerprinting age for children and on storing a scanned copy of the visa applicants&apos; travel document in the Visa Information System (VIS)&quot;, which was finalised in 2018 and looked into the necessity and proportionality of lowering the fingerprinting age in the visa procedure for children to six years. That study found that lowering the fingerprinting age would contribute better to achieving the VIS objectives, in particular in relation to the facilitation of the fight against identity fraud and of checks at external border crossing points. It also found that lowering the fingerprinting age could bring additional benefits by strengthening the prevention and fight against the abuse of children&apos;s rights, in particular by enabling the identification or verification of the identity of children who are third-country nationals in the Schengen area and who are in a situation where their rights have been, or may be, violated, for example because they are child victims of trafficking in human beings, missing children or unaccompanied minors applying for asylum. At the same time, children are a particularly vulnerable group and collecting their biometric data should be subject to stricter safeguards, including limiting the retention period for data storage, and the purposes for which those data may be used should be limited to situations where it is in the child&apos;s best interests. The study that was finalised in 2018 also showed that fingerprints of elderly persons are of lower quality and medium accuracy and recommended measures to mitigate those shortcomings. Member States should follow the recommendations identified in that study with the objective of improving the quality of fingerprints and biometric matching.</p>

               <p>The best interests of the child are a primary consideration for Member States with respect to all procedures provided for in this Regulation. The child&apos;s well-being, safety and security and the views of the child are to be taken into consideration and given due weight in accordance with the child&apos;s age and maturity. The VIS is particularly relevant where there is a risk of a child being a victim of trafficking.</p>

               <p>The visa procedure and the VIS should benefit from the technological developments related to facial image recognition. Taking live facial images upon submission of applications should be the rule when recording the facial image of applicants in the VIS, also when processing applications for long-stay visas and residence permits, where this is allowed by national law. Taking live facial images upon submission of applications will also contribute to addressing biometric vulnerabilities such as &apos;face-morphing&apos; used for identity fraud. Only facial images taken live should be used for biometric matching.</p>

The European search portal (ESP) established by Regulation (EU) 2019/817 should be used to enable fast, seamless, efficient, systematic and controlled access by Member States&apos; authorities to the EU information systems, the Europol data and the Interpol databases needed to perform their tasks, in accordance with their access rights, and to support the objectives of the VIS.</p>

               <p>The comparison of data stored in the VIS against data stored in other information systems and databases should be automated. If such a comparison reveals the existence of a correspondence, known as a &apos;hit&apos;, between any of the personal data or combination thereof in an application and a record, file or alert in those other information systems or databases, or with personal data in the ETIAS watchlist, the application should be verified manually by an operator from the competent authority. Depending on the type of data triggering the hit, the hit should be manually verified and assessed by the competent visa or immigration authority, by the ETIAS National Unit referred to in Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 or by a central authority designated by the Member State (VIS designated authority). As hits generated by law enforcement or judicial systems or databases are generally more sensitive, they should not be verified and assessed by consulates, but rather by the VIS designated authorities or the ETIAS National Units. Member States should be able to designate more than one authority as a VIS designated authority. The SIRENE Bureau should be designated as the VIS designated authority only if it is allocated sufficient additional resources enabling it to fulfil that task. The assessment of the hits performed by the competent authority should be taken into account for the decision whether to issue a short-stay visa or when assessing whether the applicant for a long-stay visa or residence permit could pose a threat to the public policy, internal security or public health of the Member States.</p>

The specific risk indicators should be defined, established, assessed <i>ex ante</i>, implemented, evaluated <i>ex post</i>, revised and deleted by the ETIAS Central Unit referred to in Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 following the consultation of a VIS Screening Board composed of representatives of the central visa authorities and the agencies involved.

               <p>In order to enable better monitoring of the use of the VIS to analyse trends concerning migratory pressure and border management, eu-LISA should be able to develop a capability for statistical reporting to the Member States, the Commission, and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency without jeopardising data integrity. Therefore, eu-LISA should store certain statistics in the central repository for reporting and statistics in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/817.

               <p>Specific provisions should apply to third-country nationals who are subject to a visa requirement, who are family members of a Union citizen to whom Directive 2004/38/EC applies or of a third-country national enjoying the right of free movement under Union law, and who do not hold a residence card as referred to in Directive 2004/38/EC. Article 21(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that every Union citizen has the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaties and laid down by the measures adopted to give those limitations and conditions effect. Those limitations and conditions are laid down in Directive 2004/38/EC.</p>

               <p>As confirmed by the Court of Justice of the European Union, such family members not only have the right to enter the territory of the Member State but also to obtain an entry visa for that purpose. Member States must grant such persons every facility to obtain the necessary visas which must be issued free of charge as soon as possible and on the basis of an accelerated procedure.</p>

               <p>The right to obtain a visa is not unconditional as it can be denied to family members on grounds of public policy, public security or public health pursuant to Directive 2004/38/EC. Against that background, the personal data of family members can be verified only where the data relate to their identification and their status and only insofar as those data are relevant for the assessment of the security or public health threat that they could represent. The examination of the visa applications of such family members should be made exclusively against the security or public health concerns, and not those related to migration risks.</p>

               <p>Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the need to ensure the implementation of a common policy on visas, a high level of security within the area without controls at the internal borders and the gradual establishment of an integrated management system for the external borders, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.</p>

               <p>This Regulation establishes strict access rules to the VIS and the necessary safeguards. It also provides for individuals&apos; rights of access, rectification, erasure and remedies in particular the right to a judicial remedy and the supervision of data processing operations by independent public authorities. Additional safeguards are introduced by this Regulation to cover for the specific needs of the new categories of data that will be processed by the VIS. This Regulation therefore respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to human dignity, the right to liberty and security, the respect for private and family life, the protection of personal data, the right to asylum and protection of the principle of non-refoulement and protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition, the right to non-discrimination, the rights of the child and the right to an effective remedy.</p>

It shall also include a detailed analysis of the data provided in the annual reports foreseen by paragraph 4 of this Article, with a view to assessing the effectiveness of access to VIS data for law enforcement purposes, as well as an assessment of whether the querying of ECRIS-TCN by the VIS has contributed to supporting the objective of assessing whether the applicant could pose a threat to public policy or public security.
