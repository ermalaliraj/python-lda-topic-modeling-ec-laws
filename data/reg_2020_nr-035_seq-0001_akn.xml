Furthermore the current Union binding occupational limit value and binding biological limit value for lead compounds under Directive 98/24/EC will be reviewed. Therefore, and in view of possible adoption of more stringent measures at the workplace, it is appropriate to postpone a decision on the inclusion of those substances in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. In addition, through implementation of Directive 2010/75/EU and its predecessors, emissions of lead and its compounds to the environment have decreased and continue to decrease as shown by the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) reporting and further reductions are expected as new BAT conclusions are adopted and as permits are updated to reflect them.</p>

               <p>In order to avoid the premature obsolescence of articles or complex products that are no longer produced after the sunset dates referred to in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, some substances (by themselves or in mixtures) included in that Annex need to be available for the production of spare parts as articles or as complex products for the repair of those articles or complex products, where those articles or complex products cannot function as intended without those spare parts, as well as where some Annex XIV substances (by themselves or in mixtures) are necessary for the repair of such articles or complex products. In order to facilitate application for authorisation for those uses, the existing transitional arrangements should be extended, allowing the adoption of implementing measures for simplified application for authorisations in such cases. In addition, the wording of the notes to the table of Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should be revised in order to ensure consistency of the terminology as regards articles and complex products in the light of the judgement of the Court of Justice in Case C-106/14<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="10">
