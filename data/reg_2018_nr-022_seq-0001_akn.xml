               <p>The Bio-based Industries Consortium Aisbl (&apos;BIC&apos;), which is a member of the BBI Joint Undertaking other than the Union, continues to be ready to support the operational costs of the BBI Joint Undertaking for the amount set out in Article 12(4) of the Statutes.

               <p>The objective of the Joint Technology Initiative on Bio-based Industries to carry out activities through the collaboration of stakeholders along the entire bio-based value chain, including small and medium-sized enterprises, research and technology centres and universities can be achieved only by enabling BIC and its constituent entities to deliver the financial contribution not only as payments to the BBI Joint Undertaking but also as financial contributions to indirect actions funded by the BBI Joint Undertaking.</p>

               <p>It is therefore necessary to amend the Statutes in order to enable BIC and its constituent entities to deliver the financial contribution for the full amount set out in Article 12(4) of the Statutes, allowing those contributions to be made not only as payments to the BBI Joint Undertaking but also as financial contributions to indirect actions funded by the BBI Joint Undertaking and to be reported to the BBI Joint Undertaking,</p>
