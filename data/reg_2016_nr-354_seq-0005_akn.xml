                     <p>Commission delegated Regulation of 30 June 2016 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) by laying down regulatory technical standards with regard to the presentation, content, review and revision of key information documents and the conditions for fulfilling the requirement to provide such documents (C(2016)3999).</p>

               <p>On 14 September 2016, the European Parliament objected to the delegated regulation adopted by the Commission on 30 June 2016 and called, together with a large majority of Member States, for a deferral of the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014.</p>

               <p>A deferral of 12 months will give additional time for those concerned to adhere to the new requirements. In the light of the exceptional circumstances, it is appropriate and justified for Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 to be amended accordingly.</p>
