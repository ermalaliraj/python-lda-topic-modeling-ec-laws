               <p>For diflufenican and pyraclostrobin, maximum residue levels (MRLs) were set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. For amitraz and permethrin, MRLs were set in Annex II and Part B of Annex III to that Regulation. For acequinocyl and metribuzin, MRLs were set in Part A of Annex III to that Regulation. For coumaphos, flumequine and streptomycin, no specific MRLs were set nor were those substances included in Annex IV to that Regulation, so the default value of 0,01 mg/kg laid down in Article 18(1)(b) thereof applies.</p>

               <p>As regards all those applications, the Authority concluded that all requirements with respect to data were met and that the modifications to the MRLs requested by the applicants were acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups. It took into account the most recent information on the toxicological properties of the substances. Neither the lifetime exposure to these substances via consumption of all food products that may contain them, nor the short-term exposure due to high consumption of the relevant products showed that there is a risk that the acceptable daily intake or the acute reference dose is exceeded.</p>

               <p>As regards coumaphos, the Authority identified concerns in relation to the chronic risk assessment, which need to be addressed by means of a risk management decision. Taking into account that Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 sets an MRL for coumaphos only in honey and considering the low contribution of that product to the chronic consumer exposure, it is appropriate to set the MRL for honey and other apiculture products in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 at the same level.</p>
