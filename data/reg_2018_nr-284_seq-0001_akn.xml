               <p>On 29 November 2012, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Japan on a Free Trade Agreement.</p>

               <p>The negotiations for an Agreement between the European Union and Japan for an Economic Partnership (&apos;the Agreement&apos;) were successfully concluded and the Agreement was signed on 17 July 2018.</p>

               <num>(3)</num>
               <p>Annex 2-D to the Agreement provides that single distilled <i>shochu</i>, as defined in subparagraph 10 of Article 3 of the Liquor Tax Law (Law No 6 of 1953) of Japan, produced by pot still and bottled in Japan, is to be allowed to be placed on the Union market in traditional bottles of four <i>go</i> (

) and one <i>sho</i> (

), corresponding to nominal quantities of 720 ml and of 1800 ml, respectively, provided that other applicable Union legal requirements are fulfilled.</p>

                     <p>Directive 2007/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 laying down rules on nominal quantities for prepacked products, repealing Council Directives 75/106/EEC and 80/232/EEC, and amending Council Directive 76/211/EEC (OJ L 247, 21.9.2007, p. 17).</p>
                  </authorialNote> provides that prepacked products can only be placed on the Union market if they are prepacked in the nominal quantities listed in section 1 of the Annex to that Directive. For spirit drinks, section 1 of the Annex to Directive 2007/45/EC refers to nine nominal quantities on the interval from 100 ml to 2000 ml. Those nominal quantities do not include the quantities of 720 ml and 1800 ml, the nominal quantities in which single distilled <i>shochu</i> produced by pot still is bottled and marketed in Japan.</p>

               <p>A derogation from the nominal quantities set out in the Annex to Directive 2007/45/EC for spirit drinks is therefore necessary to ensure that single distilled <i>shochu</i> produced by pot still and bottled in Japan can be placed on the Union market, as set out in Annex 2-D to the Agreement, in bottle sizes of 720 ml and of 1800 ml that correspond to traditional Japanese bottle sizes four <i>go</i> (

               <p>The derogation from Directive 2007/45/EC needs to be introduced by means of an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">
