               <p>Following an application from Anxiofit Ltd and ExtractumPharma Co Ltd, submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to Anxiofit-1 and reduction of subthreshold and mild anxiety (Question No EFSA-Q-2015-00006<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">

               <p>On 8 January 2016, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority, which concluded that, on the basis of the data presented, the scientific evidence is insufficient to establish a cause and effect relationship between the consumption of Anxiofit-1 and reduction of subthreshold and mild anxiety. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.</p>
