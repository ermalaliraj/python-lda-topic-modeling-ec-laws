               <p>In order to ensure a sufficient and uninterrupted supply of certain agricultural and industrial products which are unavailable in the Union and thereby avoid any disturbances in the market for those products, autonomous Common Customs Tariff (&apos;CCT&apos;) duties on those products have been suspended by Council Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="1">
                     <p>Council Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 of 17 December 2013 suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural and industrial products and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011 (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 201).</p>
                  </authorialNote>. Those products can be imported into the Union at reduced or zero duty rates.</p>

               <num>(2)</num>
               <p>The Union production of 87 products that are not listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 is inadequate or non-existent. It is therefore in the interest of the Union to suspend totally the autonomous CCT duties on those products.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d576e88">
               <num>(3)</num>
               <p>It is necessary to modify the conditions for the suspension of autonomous CCT duties for 26 products listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 in order to take into account technical product developments and economic trends in the market.</p>

               <num>(4)</num>
               <p>For certain products listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013, the classification in the Combined Nomenclature (CN) of the products covered by suspensions should be amended.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d576e100">
               <num>(5)</num>
               <p>It is also necessary, in the interest of the Union, to amend the end date for the mandatory review of 720 products listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 in order to allow duty-free imports beyond that date. The autonomous CCT duty suspensions for those products have been reviewed and new revised dates should be set for their next mandatory review.</p>

               <num>(6)</num>
               <p>It is no longer in the interest of the Union to maintain the suspension of autonomous CCT duties for 13 products listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013. The suspensions for those products should therefore be deleted. Moreover, according to the communication from the Commission concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">
                     <p>OJ C 363, 13.12.2011, p. 6.</p>
                  </authorialNote> (the &apos;Commission communication&apos;), for practical reasons, requests for tariff suspensions or quotas where the amount of uncollected customs duty is estimated to be less than EUR 15000 per year cannot be taken into consideration. The mandatory review of the existing suspensions has indicated that imports in relation to 197 products listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 do not reach that threshold. Those suspensions should therefore be deleted.</p>

               <p>In the interest of clarity, and taking into account the number of amendments to be made, the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 should be replaced.</p>

This Regulation should therefore enter into force as a matter of urgency,</p>
