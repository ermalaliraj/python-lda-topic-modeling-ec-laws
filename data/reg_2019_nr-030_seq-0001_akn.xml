               <p>Pursuant to Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, respect for human rights constitutes one of the values common to the Member States. The European Community resolved in 1995 to make respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms an essential element of its relations with third countries. It was decided to insert a clause to that end in any new trade, cooperation and association agreement of a general nature concluded with third countries.</p>

               <p>Article 2(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Charter) states that no one shall be condemned to the death penalty or executed.

               <p>Article 4 of the Charter states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. On 20 March 2012, the Council approved &apos;Guidelines to EU policy towards third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (An up-date of the Guidelines)&apos;. In accordance with those guidelines, third countries should be urged to prevent the use and production of, and trade in, equipment which is designed to inflict torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and prevent the abuse of any other equipment to these ends. Moreover, the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment should impose clear limits on the use of the death penalty. Therefore, capital punishment is not to be considered a lawful penalty under any circumstances.</p>

               <p>It is therefore appropriate to lay down Union rules on trade with third countries in goods which could be used for the purpose of capital punishment, and in goods which could be used for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. These rules are instrumental in promoting respect for human life and for fundamental human rights and thus serve the purpose of protecting public morals. Such rules should ensure that Union economic operators do not derive any benefits from trade which either promotes or otherwise facilitates the implementation of policies on capital punishment or on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which are not compatible with the relevant EU Guidelines, the Charter and international conventions and treaties.</p>

That definition should be interpreted taking into account the case-law on the interpretation of the corresponding term in the European Convention on Human Rights and in relevant texts adopted by the Union or its Member States. The definition of &apos;other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&apos;, which is not found in that Convention, should be in line with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights.

                     <p>Resolution 34/169 of 17 December 1979 of the General Assembly of the United Nations.</p>
                  </authorialNote> provides that law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty. The Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders in 1990, provide that, in carrying out their duty, law enforcement officials should, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms.</p>

               <p>In view of this, the Basic Principles advocate the development of non-lethal incapacitating weapons for use in appropriate situations, while admitting that the use of such weapons should be carefully controlled. In this context, certain equipment traditionally used by the police for self-defence and riot-control purposes has been modified in such a way that it can be used to apply electric shocks and chemical substances to incapacitate persons. There are indications that, in several countries, such weapons are abused for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p>

It should also be noted that the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners provide that other instruments of restraint must not be used except as a precaution against escape during a transfer, on medical grounds as directed by a medical officer, or, if other methods of control fail, in order to prevent a prisoner from injuring himself or others, or from damaging property.</p>

               <p>Given the differences between capital punishment, on the one hand, and torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment on the other, it is appropriate to lay down a specific export authorisation system with a view to preventing the use of certain goods for capital punishment. Such a system should take into account the fact that a number of countries have abolished capital punishment for all crimes and have made an international commitment on this issue. As there is a risk of re-export to countries that have not done so, certain conditions and requirements should be imposed when authorising exports to countries that have abolished capital punishment. It is therefore appropriate to grant a general export authorisation for exports to those countries that have abolished capital punishment for all crimes and confirmed that abolition through an international commitment.</p>

               <p>If a country has not abolished capital punishment for all crimes and confirmed that abolition through an international commitment, the competent authorities should, when examining a request for an export authorisation, check whether there is a risk that the end-user in the country of destination would use the exported goods for such punishment. Appropriate conditions and requirements should be imposed to control sales or transfers to third parties by the end-user. If multiple shipments between the same exporter and end-user take place, the competent authorities should be allowed to review the status of the end-user on a periodic basis, for example every six months, rather than every time an export authorisation for a shipment is granted, without prejudice to the right of the competent authorities to annul, suspend, modify or revoke an export authorisation where warranted.</p>

               <p>In order to limit the administrative burden for exporters, the competent authorities should be allowed to grant an exporter a global authorisation for all shipments of medicinal products from the exporter to a specific end-user for a fixed period of time, specifying, where necessary, a quantity corresponding to the end-user&apos;s normal use of such products. Such authorisation should be valid for between one and three years with a possible extension of up to two years.</p>

               <p>Medicinal products falling within the scope of this Regulation may be subject to controls in accordance with international conventions on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, such as the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Since such controls are not applied to prevent the relevant medicinal products from being used for capital punishment but to prevent illicit drug trafficking, the export controls of this Regulation should be applied in addition to those international controls.
