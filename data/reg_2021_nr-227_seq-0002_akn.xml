               <p>In order to ensure a sufficient and uninterrupted supply of certain agricultural and industrial products which are produced in insufficient quantities in the Union and thereby avoid any disturbances in the market for those products, autonomous tariff quotas were opened by Council Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="1">
                     <p>Council Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013 of 17 December 2013 opening and providing for the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and industrial products, and repealing Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 319).</p>

               <p>As it is in the Union&apos;s interest to ensure an adequate supply of certain industrial products and having regard to the fact that identical, equivalent or substitute products are not produced in sufficient quantities within the Union, it is necessary to open new tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2587, 09.2567, 09.2568, 09.2569 and 09.2570 at zero duty rates for appropriate quantities of those products.</p>

               <p>In relation to tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2589, 09.2668, 09.2683 and 09.2872, the quota volumes should be increased, as an increase is in the interest of the Union.</p>
