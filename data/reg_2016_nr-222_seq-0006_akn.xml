                     <p>Regulation (EU) No 1011/2012 of the European Central Bank of 17 October 2012 concerning statistics on holdings of securities (ECB/2012/24) (OJ L 305, 1.11.2012, p. 6).</p>
                  </authorialNote>, are necessary in order to ensure that the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) is provided with adequate information on the holdings of securities of banking groups. These additional attributes will allow a more thorough analysis of risks and exposures within the financial system to be carried out. This, in turn, will allow for a more in-depth analysis of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Extending the scope of the credit risk and accounting information reported is particularly important in terms of financial stability analysis and such data will also be useful for prudential supervision purposes. It is also needed in order to be able to assess the Eurosystem&apos;s risk exposure in relation to counterparties in monetary policy operations. The structure of certain provisions of the Regulation should also be amended in order to clarify reporting agents&apos; statistical reporting requirements for both sectoral and group data.</p>
