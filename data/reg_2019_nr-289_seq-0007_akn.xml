               <p>On 21 September 2016, the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) adopted a scientific opinion on erucic acid in feed and food<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">
                     <p>
                        <i>EFSA Journal</i> 2016;14(11):4593</p>
                  </authorialNote>. EFSA established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 7 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day for erucic acid. The highest dietary exposure levels were observed for infants and other children with exposure levels above the TDI. This may indicate a risk for young individuals with high erucic acid exposure.</p>

               <p>Data on the presence of erucic acid in vegetable oils and fats indicate that for most vegetable oils and fats, lower levels can be achieved by applying good practices, e.g. by using varieties low in erucic acid. Therefore, it is appropriate to lower the maximum level for vegetable oils, with the exception of camelina oil, mustard oil and borage oil, to the level established by Codex Alimentarius for low-erucic acid rapeseed oil<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">

               <p>For camelina oil, mustard oil and borage oil, evidence has been provided demonstrating that it is not possible to achieve lower levels by applying good practices as for these species there are no varieties of which the vegetable oils extracted from these plants contain levels of erucic acid lower than the maximum level proposed for the other vegetable oils. Therefore and given that these oils are of less significance for the human exposure than other vegetable oils, the maximum level for erucic acid in camelina oil, mustard oil and borage oil should remain the same. Furthermore, in order to avoid the closure of small and micro size enterprises in certain Member States, it is appropriate to exempt mustard oil produced and consumed locally in small quantities of the application of the maximum level, with acceptance of the competent authority.</p>

               <p>Given that the maximum level for vegetable oils and fats applies also to vegetable oils used as ingredient in food, there is no need to establish a maximum level for erucic acid in foods containing added vegetable oils and fats.</p>

               <p>Given the high concentration of erucic acid in mustard there is a risk of significant exposure to erucic acid through consumption of mustard. Therefore, it is appropriate to establish a maximum level for erucic acid in mustard.</p>
