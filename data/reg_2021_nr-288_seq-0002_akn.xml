               <p>On 30 January 2009, the European Food Safety Authority (&apos;the Authority&apos;) adopted an opinion on cadmium in food<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">
                     <p>EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM); Scientific opinion on cadmium in food. <i>EFSA Journal</i> 2009(980) 1-139, https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.980.</p>
                  </authorialNote>. The Authority concluded that cadmium is primarily toxic to the kidney, especially to the proximal tubular cells where it accumulates over time and may cause renal dysfunction. In view of the toxic effects of cadmium on the kidneys, the Authority established a tolerable weekly intake for cadmium of 2,5 Î¼g/kg body weight. The Authority further concluded that the mean exposure for adults across the Union is close to, or slightly exceeds, the tolerable weekly intake. It also concluded that subgroups such as vegetarians, children, smokers and people living in highly contaminated areas may exceed the tolerable weekly intake by about 2-fold. Therefore, the CONTAM Panel concluded that the current exposure to cadmium at the population level needs to be reduced. Following that opinion, the Authority issued, on 17 January 2012, a scientific report where it confirmed that children and adults at the 95th percentile exposure could exceed the health-based guidance values<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">

               <p>However, the Commission considered that an immediate reduction of the existing MLs was not appropriate at the time. Therefore, it adopted Commission Recommendation 2014/193/EU<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="6">
                     <p>Commission Recommendation 2014/193/EU of 4 April 2014 on the on the reduction of the presence of cadmium in foodstuffs (OJ L 104, 8.4.2014, p. 80).</p>
                  </authorialNote>, which called on Member States to ensure that the already available mitigation methods were communicated and promoted to farmers and started or continued to be implemented, to regularly monitor the progress of the mitigation measures by collecting occurrence data on cadmium levels in foodstuffs and to report the data, in particular on cadmium levels close to or exceeding the maximum levels, by February 2018.</p>

               <p>An evaluation of the most recent occurrence data gathered after the implementation of the mitigation measures shows that it is now achievable to reduce the presence of cadmium in many foodstuffs. Therefore, it is appropriate to lower the existing maximum levels for cadmium or to establish maximum levels for those foodstuffs.</p>
