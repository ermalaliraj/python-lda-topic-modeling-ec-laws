               <p>Following an application from Probi AB, submitted pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> 299v (Lp299v) and an increase of non-haem iron absorption (Question No EFSA- Q-2015-00696<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">

               <p>On 25 July 2016, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority, which concluded that the evidence provided was insufficient to establish a cause and effect relationship between the consumption of Lp299v and an increase of non-haem iron absorption. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.</p>
