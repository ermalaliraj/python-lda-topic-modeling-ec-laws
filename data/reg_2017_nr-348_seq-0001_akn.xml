               <p>The extension from 1 January 2021 of those special schemes to distance sales of goods and services other than telecommunications, broadcasting or electronically supplied services requires extending the scope of the rules of this Regulation concerning the provision of information and transfer of money between the Member State of identification and the Member States of consumption.</p>

               <p>Due to the extended scope of the special schemes to cover also distance sales of goods and all services, the number of transactions to be reported in the VAT return will increase considerably. In order to allow the Member State of identification sufficient time to treat the VAT returns submitted by taxable persons under the special scheme, the deadline for transferring the information of the VAT return and the VAT amount paid to every Member State of consumption should be extended by 10 days.</p>

               <p>The extension of the special schemes to distance sales of goods imported from third territories or third countries requires that the customs authority of the Member State of importation is able to identify imports of goods in small consignments for which value added tax (VAT) is to be paid through one of the special schemes. The identification number under which VAT is paid should therefore be communicated in advance to enable customs authorities to check its validity upon importation of the goods.</p>

               <p>Taxable persons using such special schemes may be subject to requests for records from and administrative enquiries by the Member State of identification and all the Member States of consumption where goods or services are supplied to. To reduce the administrative burden and compliance costs for businesses as well as for tax administrations of multiple requests for records and administrative enquiries and to avoid duplication of work, such requests and enquiries should as much as possible be coordinated by the Member State of identification.</p>
