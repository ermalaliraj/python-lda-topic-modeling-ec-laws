               <p>In order to ensure the sufficient and uninterrupted supply of certain goods insufficiently produced in the Union and to avoid disturbances on the market for certain agricultural and industrial products, autonomous tariff quotas were opened by Council Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="1">
                     <p>Council Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013 of 17 December 2013 opening and providing for the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and industrial products, and repealing Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 319).</p>

               <p>For those reasons, it is necessary to open, with effect from 1 January 2019, six new tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2600, 09.2617, 09.2720, 09.2738, 09.2740 and 09.2742 at zero duty rates for appropriate volumes of those products. For the two new tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2740 and 09.2742, it is in the interest of the Union to open those tariff quotas only for the purposes of using the products concerned for the manufacture of specific goods produced in the Union. The application of those two tariff quotas should therefore be made conditional on the specific use of the products in accordance with Article 254 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">

               <p>The classification in the CN of the products currently covered by the tariff quota with order number 09.2844 has been clarified.

For the two tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2668 and 09.2850, it is in the interest of the Union to maintain those tariff quotas only for the purposes of the incorporation of the products concerned into specific goods produced in the Union.
