               <p>The Authority concluded that all requirements with respect to data were met and that the modification to the MRLs requested by the applicant was acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups. The Authority took into account the most recent information on the toxicological properties of the substance. The lifetime exposure to the substance via consumption of all food products that may contain it showed that there is no risk that the acceptable daily intake is exceeded. Moreover, the Authority concluded that the establishment of an acute reference dose is not necessary on the basis of the low acute toxicity profile of the active substance.</p>
