               <p>The Union has set the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of persons is ensured. In order to ensure the free circulation of public documents within the Union and, thereby, promote the free movement of Union citizens, the Union should adopt concrete measures to simplify the existing administrative requirements relating to the presentation in a Member State of certain public documents issued by the authorities of another Member State.</p>

               <p>All Member States are contracting parties to the Hague Convention of 5 October 1961 Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents (the &apos;Apostille Convention&apos;), which introduced a system for the simplified circulation of public documents issued by Contracting States to that Convention.</p>

               <p>In accordance with the principle of mutual trust and in order to promote the free movement of persons within the Union, this Regulation should set out a system for further simplification of administrative formalities for the circulation of certain public documents and their certified copies where those public documents and the certified copies thereof are issued by a Member State authority for presentation in another Member State.</p>
            </recital>

               <p>The system set out in this Regulation should be without prejudice to persons being able to continue to benefit, if they so wish, from other systems which exempt public documents from legalisation or similar formality and which are applicable between Member States. In particular, this Regulation should be regarded as a separate and autonomous instrument from the Apostille Convention.</p>

               <p>Coexistence between the system set out in this Regulation and other systems applicable between Member States should be safeguarded. As regards the Apostille Convention, while it should not be possible for Member States&apos; authorities to require an apostille when a person presents to them a public document covered by this Regulation and issued in another Member State, this Regulation should not prevent Member States from issuing an apostille where a person chooses to request it. Moreover, this Regulation should not prevent a person from continuing to use in one Member State an apostille issued in another. Accordingly, the Apostille Convention could still be used, at a person&apos;s request, in relations between Member States. Where a person requests an apostille on a public document covered by this Regulation, the issuing national authorities should use appropriate means to inform that person that under the system set out in this Regulation an apostille is no longer necessary if that person intends to present the document in another Member State. In any case, Member States should make that information available through any appropriate means.</p>

This Regulation should also cover public documents issued for a person by the Member State of which that person is a national to attest that that person does not have a criminal record. Furthermore, this Regulation should cover public documents the presentation of which can be required of citizens of the Union residing in a Member State of which they are not nationals when, in accordance with the relevant Union legislation, they wish to vote or stand as candidates in elections to the European Parliament or in municipal elections in their Member State of residence.</p>

               <p>In order to guarantee a high level of security and data protection in the context of the application of this Regulation and to prevent fraud, the Commission should ensure that IMI guarantees the security of public documents and provides a safe means of electronic transmission of those documents. The Commission should make a tool available in IMI that certifies information exchanged through the system when it is exported outside the system. Furthermore, Member States&apos; authorities which exchange information regarding public documents should take the necessary measures to ensure that, in line with Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012, the public documents and the personal data exchanged through IMI are collected, processed and used for purposes in line with those for which they were originally submitted. Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 sets out the necessary provisions to ensure the protection of personal data and a high level of security and confidentiality for the exchange of information in IMI, and defines the responsibilities of the Commission in this regard. Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 also stipulates that IMI actors are to exchange and process personal data only for the purposes defined in the Union legal act on which the exchange is based and in line with the purpose for which they were originally submitted.</p>
