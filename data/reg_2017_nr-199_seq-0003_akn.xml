               <p>Potassium polyaspartate acts as a stabiliser against tartrate crystal precipitation in wine (red, ros√© and white wine). It enhances the keeping quality and stability of wine and its use does not have an impact on the sensory properties. It is therefore appropriate to include potassium polyaspartate in the Union list of food additives and to assign E 456 as E-number to that additive to enable its authorisation as a stabiliser in wine in the specific provisions of the relevant Union legislation.</p>
