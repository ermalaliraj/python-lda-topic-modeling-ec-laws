               <p>On 21 November 2008, the Council invited the Commission to proceed to an evaluation of that plant health regime.</p>

               <p>In the light of the outcome of that evaluation and the experience gained from the application of Directive 2000/29/EC, that Directive should be replaced. In order to ensure uniform application of the new rules, the act replacing that Directive should take the form of a Regulation.</p>

               <p>Plant health is very important for plant production, forests, natural and planted areas, natural ecosystems, ecosystem services and biodiversity in the Union. Plant health is threatened by species injurious to plants and plant products which now present a greater risk of being introduced into the Union territory owing to globalisation of trade and climate change. In order to fight that threat, it is necessary to adopt measures concerning the determination of the phytosanitary risks posed by those pests and the reduction of those risks to an acceptable level.</p>

               <p>The need for such measures has long been recognised. They have formed the subject of international agreements and international conventions, including the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) of 6 December 1951 concluded at the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and its new, revised text approved by the FAO Conference in November 1997 at its 29th session. The Union and all its Member States are contracting parties to the IPPC.</p>

               <p>It has become apparent that for the determination of the scope of this Regulation it is important to take into account bio-geographical factors to avoid the introduction into and spread within the territory of the European Union of pests not present in that territory. Consequently, Ceuta, Melilla and, with the exception of Madeira and the Azores, the outermost regions of Member States referred to in Article 355(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be excluded from the territorial scope of this Regulation. References to third countries should be read as references also to those excluded territories.</p>

               <p>Directive 2000/29/EC sets out rules concerning official controls to be carried out by the competent authorities as regards protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community. It requires the Member States to carry out adequate and efficient control measures. Such adequate and efficient official controls measures should also be continued in the future. As part of the &apos;Smarter Rules for Safer Food&apos; package, this Regulation should only provide for a limited number of provisions on official controls since those rules should be provided for in the framework of the horizontal legislation on official controls.</p>

               <p>Criteria should be set out for the identification of pests for which the adoption of measures is necessary to prevent their introduction into and spread within the entire Union territory. Such pests are referred to as &apos;Union quarantine pests&apos;. Criteria should also be set out for the identification of pests for which it is necessary to adopt measures of control only as regards one or more parts of that territory. Such pests are referred to as &apos;protected zone quarantine pests&apos;. Where those pests are plants, the implementation of this Regulation should focus in particular on plants which are parasitic to other plants, when they are most injurious to plant health.</p>

               <p>Member States should take all necessary phytosanitary measures to eradicate Union quarantine pests, when found to be present in their territories. It is appropriate to set out measures which may be taken by Member States in such a case. It is also appropriate to set out the principles which the Member States should follow when deciding which measures should be taken. Those measures should include the establishment of demarcated areas, consisting of an infested zone and a buffer zone and, when applicable, the determination of actions which should be taken by a professional operator or other person in order to eliminate the quarantine pest or in order to prevent the spread of that pest.</p>

That preliminary assessment should take into account specific criteria appropriate for the plant, plant product or other object concerned.
