               <p>Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 contains two lists of harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances. Table 3.1 lists the harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances based on the criteria set out in Parts 2 to 5 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. Table 3.2 lists the harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances based on the criteria set out in Annex VI to Council Directive 67/548/EEC<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">

               <p>Proposals for new, updated or deleted harmonised classification and labelling of certain substances have been submitted to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) pursuant to Article 37 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. Based on the opinions on those proposals issued by the Committee for Risk Assessment of ECHA (RAC), as well as on the comments received from the parties concerned, it is appropriate to introduce, update or delete harmonised classification and labelling of certain substances.</p>

               <p>With regard to the substance lead, RAC proposes in its scientific opinion of 5 December 2013 to classify it as toxic for reproduction category 1A. However, in view of the lack of certainty regarding the bioavailability of lead in the massive form, a distinction needs to be made between the massive form (particle size more than or equal to 1 mm) and the powder form (particle size of less than 1 mm). It is therefore appropriate to introduce a specific concentration limit (SCL) of ≥ 0,03 % for the powder form and a generic concentration limit (GCL) of ≥ 0,3 % for the massive form.</p>

               <p>With regard to the copper substances, the environmental classification recommended in the RAC opinions of 4 December 2014 should be included in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 since sufficient scientific evidence is available justifying this new classification. However, the proposed M-factors for long-term aquatic hazard should not be included since they require further assessment by RAC in view of scientific data on aquatic toxicity presented by industry after the RAC opinion was forwarded to the Commission.</p>
