               <p>Member States have been affected by the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak in an unprecedented manner. The current public health crisis hampers growth in Member States, which in turn aggravates the serious liquidity shortages due to the sudden and significant increase in public investments needed in their healthcare systems and other sectors of their economies. That has created an exceptional situation which needs to be addressed with specific measures.</p>

In order to contribute to an effective response to the current public health crisis, the scope of support from the ERDF was considerably expanded.</p>

               <p>However, the serious negative effects on Union economies and societies are becoming worse.

               <p>With a view to alleviating the burden on public budgets responding to the public health crisis, Member States should be given the exceptional possibility to request, for cohesion policy programmes, a co-financing rate of 100 % to be applied for the accounting year 2020-2021, in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding. Based on an assessment of the application of that exceptional co-financing rate, the Commission could propose an extension of this measure.</p>

               <p>In order to provide additional flexibility to Member States for the reallocation of resources with a view to providing tailor-made responses to the public health crisis, possibilities for financial transfers under the Investment for growth and jobs goal between the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund should be introduced or enhanced. Furthermore, transfer possibilities between categories of regions should also be exceptionally increased for Member States given the widespread impact of the public health crisis, while respecting Treaty objectives for cohesion policy. Such transfers should not affect the resources under the European territorial cooperation goal, the additional allocations to outermost regions, support to the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) or the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived.</p>

               <p>In order to enable Member States to deploy quickly available resources to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak and taking into account that, given the advanced stage of implementation of the 2014-2020 programming period, the reallocation of resources can only concern resources available for programming for the year 2020, it is justified to exempt, on an exceptional basis, Member States from the need to comply with thematic concentration requirements for the remainder of the programming period.</p>

               <p>In order to enable Member States to concentrate on the necessary response to the COVID‚Äê19 outbreak and to reduce administrative burdens, certain procedural requirements linked to programme implementation and audits should be simplified. In particular, Partnership Agreements should no longer be amended for the remainder of the programming period, whether to reflect prior changes in operational programmes or to introduce any other changes. The deadlines for the submission of the annual implementation reports for the year 2019 and for the transmission of the Commission&apos;s summary report based on those annual implementation reports should be postponed. As regards the Funds and the EMFF, an extended possibility for audit authorities to make use of a non-statistical sampling method should also be explicitly provided for in respect of the accounting year 2019-2020.</p>

               <p>It is appropriate to specify that eligibility of expenditure should be exceptionally allowed for completed or fully implemented operations that foster crisis response capacities in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. It should be possible for such operations to be selected even before the necessary programme amendment is approved by the Commission. Specific arrangements for invoking the COVID-19 outbreak as a reason of <i>force majeure</i> in the context of decommitment should be provided.</p>
