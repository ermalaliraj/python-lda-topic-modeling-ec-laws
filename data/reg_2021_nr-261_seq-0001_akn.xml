                     <p>Council Regulation (EU) 2020/1706 of 13 November 2020 opening and providing for the management of autonomous Union tariff quotas for certain fishery products for the 2021-2023 period (OJ L 385, 17.11.2020, p. 3).</p>
                  </authorialNote> opens and provides for the management of autonomous Union tariff quotas for certain fishery products for the period 2021-2023. Appropriate volumes have been decided for each tariff quota to ensure an adequate supply to the Union industry for that period.</p>

               <p>Supplies of certain fishery products in the Union currently depend on imports from third countries. In the last decades, the Union has become more dependent on imports to meet its consumption of fishery products. In order not to jeopardise the Union production of fishery products and to ensure an adequate supply to the Union processing industry, import duties should be suspended for Patagonian squid, herring preserved in brine, frozen herrings, frozen fillets and flaps of herrings, fillets of redfish and various species of frozen fish within tariff quotas of an appropriate volume.</p>

                     <p>Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic and Energy Community, of the one part, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the other part (OJ L 149, 30.4.2021, p. 10).</p>
                  </authorialNote> between the Union and the United Kingdom (the TCA) provisionally applies since 1 January 2021. The TCA provides for a duty-free quota-free access of originating fishery products. However, the British overseas countries and territories (OCTs) are no longer associated with the Union and no longer enjoy tariff reductions for exports of fishery products to the Union.</p>

                  </authorialNote> providing for quotas for certain fish and fishery products expired on 30 April 2021.
