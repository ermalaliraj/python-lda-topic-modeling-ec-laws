                     <p>Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs (OJ L 364, 20.12.2006, p. 5).</p>

               <p>Poppy seeds are obtained from the opium poppy (<i>Papaver somniferum</i> L.). The opium poppy plant contains opium alkaloids such as morphine and codeine. Poppy seeds do not contain the opium alkaloids, or contain only very low levels, but can become contaminated with alkaloids as a result of insect damage, or through external contamination of the seeds during harvesting, when particles of dust from the straw (including the capsule wall) adhere to the seeds.</p>

               <p>In 2018, the European Food Safety Authority (&apos;the Authority&apos;) adopted an update of the scientific opinion on opium alkaloids in poppy seeds<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">
                     <p>Update of the Scientific Opinion on opium alkaloids in poppy seeds. <i>EFSA Journal</i> 2018;16(5):5243, 119 pp. https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5243</p>
                  </authorialNote>. The Authority confirmed the acute reference dose (ARfD) of 10 Î¼g morphine/kg body weight (bw) and concluded that the concentration of codeine in the poppy seed samples should be taken into account by converting codeine to morphine equivalents, using a factor of 0,2. The ARfD is therefore a group ARfD for morphine and codeine, expressed in morphine equivalents. Exposure estimates indicate that the group ARfD is likely to be exceeded, in particular, when large portions are consumed, or if foods containing unprocessed poppy seeds are consumed.</p>

               <num>(4)</num>
               <p>Maximum levels for morphine and codeine, expressed in morphine equivalents, should therefore be set for poppy seeds placed on the market for the final consumer and for bakery products containing poppy seeds or derived products thereof. Those levels should be set taking into account that food processing may reduce the alkaloid content in the raw poppy seeds by 25-100 % in the final product. As it is appropriate for the producer of bakery products to have detailed information, including the morphine equivalent content, on the poppy seeds used as ingredients in bakery products, the supplier of poppy seeds should provide that information to the producer of bakery products.</p>
