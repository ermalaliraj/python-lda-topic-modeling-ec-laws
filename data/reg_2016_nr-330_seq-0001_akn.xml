               <p>The scientific evaluation of the performance of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 carried out by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) has shown a number of problems with the application of that Regulation. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has suggested a re-evaluation of the management strategy, in particular following a change in its perception of the North Sea stock.</p>

               <p>New multiannual plans for multi-species fisheries in various Atlantic regions, based on Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, are currently being prepared. Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 will eventually be superseded, for each relevant area, by those new multiannual plans for multi-species fisheries. Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 will therefore continue to apply for only a short period of time. However, a number of urgent amendments should nevertheless be made to Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 to cover the period until the new multiannual plans for multi-species fisheries start to apply.</p>

               <p>The fishing effort regime set out in Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 resulted in a number of achievements concerning selectivity and other measures to avoid catching cod, but it has become an obstacle to the implementation of the landing obligation, as it hampers further adaptation of fishing patterns, such as the choice of area and gear. The fishing effort regime should therefore be discontinued. As Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 triggered considerable improvements in selectivity and cod avoidance through incentives that were linked to the fishing effort regime and through national measures (cod avoidance or discard reduction plans), it is of utmost importance that, while the landing obligation is introduced for all catches of cod in accordance with the timetable for its introduction set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, Member States having a direct interest in the fisheries continue, or further develop, those national measures.</p>

If the stocks fall below safeguard biomass levels (MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>) available in scientific advice consistent with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, all necessary measures to address the situation should be taken.</p>

               <p>In addition to the fishing effort regime, Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 introduced a system of special fishing permits linked to a limitation of the total capacity of fishing vessels&apos; engine power in a relevant area. In order to avoid the disruptive dislocation of fishing activity which could have a negative impact on the stocks&apos; recovery, it is appropriate to maintain that system, while the fishing effort regime itself is being completely discontinued.</p>
