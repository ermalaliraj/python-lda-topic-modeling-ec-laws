               <p>The Commission communication of 29 November 2017 entitled &apos;The Future of Food and Farming&apos; concludes that the common agricultural policy (CAP) should continue to step up its response to future challenges and opportunities by boosting employment, growth and investment, by fighting and adapting to climate change and by bringing research and innovation out of the laboratories and onto fields and markets. The CAP should furthermore address citizens&apos; concerns regarding sustainable agricultural production.</p>

               <p>In accordance with Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the implementation of the CAP should take account of the objectives of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Union&apos;s obligations on climate change mitigation and development cooperation.</p>

               <p>The current CAP&apos;s compliance-driven delivery model should be adjusted to ensure a greater focus on results and performance. Accordingly, the Union should set the basic policy objectives, types of intervention and basic Union requirements while greater responsibility and accountability for meeting those objectives should be borne by the Member States. As a consequence, there is a need to ensure greater subsidiarity and flexibility in order to take better account of the local conditions and needs. Accordingly, under the new CAP delivery model, Member States should be responsible for tailoring their CAP interventions in line with their specific needs and basic Union requirements in order to maximise their contribution to Union&apos;s CAP objectives. In order to continue to ensure a common approach and a level playing field, Member States should also establish and design the compliance and control framework for beneficiaries, including compliance with standards for good agricultural and environmental conditions and statutory management requirements.</p>

It is important to provide financing for all interventions and measures in order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CAP.

Moreover, in order to ensure the transparency of the system of checks to be carried out at national level, in particular as regards procedures for authorisation, validation and payment, and to reduce the administrative and audit burden for the Commission and for the Member States where accreditation of each individual paying agency is required, the number of authorities and bodies to which those responsibilities are delegated should be restricted while respecting the constitutional provisions of each Member State.

               <p>Where a Member State accredits more than one paying agency, it should designate a single public coordinating body in order to ensure consistency in the management of the EAGF and EAFRD, to provide for a liaison between the Commission and the various accredited paying agencies, and to ensure that the information requested by the Commission concerning the operations of several paying agencies is provided promptly. That coordinating body should also take and coordinate actions with a view to resolving any deficiencies of a common nature encountered at national level, should keep the Commission informed of any follow-up, and should ensure the harmonised application of the Union rules, taking account of any limitation or restrictions due to the constitutional provisions in force.</p>

It should, therefore, be explicitly provided in this Regulation that only expenditure effected by accredited paying agencies can be reimbursed from the Union budget. In addition, the expenditure financed by the Union for the interventions referred to in Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 should have a corresponding output regarding, and should comply with, the basic Union requirements and the governance systems.</p>

               <p>Budgetary discipline also requires the annual ceiling for expenditure financed by the EAGF to be respected in all circumstances and at every stage of the budget procedure and of the implementation of the budget. Consequently, it is necessary for the national ceiling for the direct payments for each Member State set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 to be regarded as a financial ceiling for such direct payments for the Member State concerned and for the reimbursement of those payments to remain within that financial ceiling.</p>

               <p>With a view to ensuring that the amounts for the financing of the CAP comply with the annual ceilings, the financial discipline mechanism by which the level of direct support is adjusted should be maintained. An agricultural reserve should be maintained to support the agricultural sector in the event of market developments or crises affecting agricultural production or distribution. Article 12(2), point (d), of the Financial Regulation provides that non-committed appropriations may be carried over only to the following financial year, within the meaning of Article 9 of the Financial Regulation (&apos;budgetary year&apos;). In order to simplify significantly the implementation for beneficiaries and national administrations, a roll-over mechanism should be used, using any unused amounts of the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector established in the year 2022. For that purpose, a derogation from Article 12(2), point (d), of the Financial Regulation is necessary, allowing for non-committed appropriations of the agricultural reserve to be carried over to finance the agricultural reserve in the following budgetary years until the year 2027. Furthermore, as regards the budgetary year 2022, a derogation is necessary as the total unused amount of the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector available at the end of the budgetary year 2022 should be carried over to the budgetary year 2023 to the corresponding line of the new agricultural reserve established under this Regulation without being fully returned to the budgetary lines which cover direct payment interventions under the CAP Strategic Plan. However, in order to maximise the amounts to be reimbursed to farmers in the budgetary year 2023, all other availabilities under the EAGF sub-ceiling for the budgetary year 2023 set out in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 should be used first to set up the new agricultural reserve in the budgetary year 2023.</p>

               <p>In order to avoid an excessive administrative burden for national administrations and farmers, to simplify procedures as much as possible and to limit the complexity of aid application forms, reimbursement of the amounts carried over from the preceding agricultural financial year (&apos;financial year&apos;) in relation to financial discipline applied should not take place either where financial discipline is applied for a second subsequent year (year N+1), or where the overall amount of non-committed appropriations represents less than 0,2 % of the EAGF annual ceiling.</p>

Those measures should therefore be based on the financial envelopes fixed in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 16 December 2020 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, as well as on new own resources, including a roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="9">

Furthermore, the Commission should make full use of its management powers at all times to ensure compliance with the annual ceiling and, if necessary, should propose appropriate measures to the European Parliament and to the Council, or only to the Council, as appropriate, to redress the budgetary position. If, at the end of a budgetary year, the annual ceiling cannot be complied with as a result of the reimbursements requested by the Member States, the Commission should be able to take measures allowing the provisional distribution of the available amounts among the Member States in proportion to their as yet unpaid requests for reimbursement, as well as measures ensuring compliance with the ceiling fixed for the year concerned. Payments for that year should be charged to the following budgetary year and the total amount of Union financing per Member State as well as any compensation to be carried out with respect to Member States should be definitively established in order to ensure that the established amount is complied with.</p>

It is also necessary to lay down detailed rules governing those payments. The automatic decommitment rule should help to speed up execution of interventions and to contribute to sound financial management. The rules governing the national frameworks of Member States with regional interventions as set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 also provide a tool for Member States to ensure execution and sound financial management.</p>

A failure by the Member States to comply with the payment deadlines laid down in Union law might create serious difficulties for the beneficiaries and could jeopardise the Union&apos;s yearly budgeting. Therefore, expenditure made without respecting deadlines for payments should be excluded from Union financing.

Given the importance of a properly functioning integrated system, it is necessary to set quality requirements. Member States should carry out an annual quality assessment of the identification system for agricultural parcels, of the geo-spatial application system and of the area monitoring system. Member States should also address any deficiencies and, if so requested by the Commission, set up an action plan.</p>

Hence, sharing land-parcel identification system and other integrated administration and control system data has become necessary for environmental and climate purposes at national and Union level. Provision should therefore be made for sharing the data collected through the integrated system, which is relevant for environmental and climate purposes, between Member States&apos; public authorities and with the Union institutions and bodies. In order to increase efficiency in using data available to different public authorities for the production of European statistics, it should also be provided that data from the integrated system is to be made available for statistical purposes to bodies which are part of the European Statistical System.</p>

               <p>Conditionality is an important element of the CAP which ensures that payments promote a high degree of sustainability and ensure a level playing field for farmers within Member States and within the Union, in particular with regard to the social, environmental and climate elements of the CAP but also concerning public health and animal welfare. This implies that controls should be carried out and, where necessary, penalties should be applied to ensure the effectiveness of the conditionality system.

                  </authorialNote>, to ensure the link between the farmer&apos;s behaviour and the penalty, it should be laid down that, as a general rule, the penalty should be calculated on the basis of the payments granted or to be granted in the calendar year in which the non-compliance occurred. However, where the nature of the finding does not allow for the year in which the non-compliance occurred to be established, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the penalty system, it is necessary to establish that, for those cases, the penalty should be calculated on the basis of the payments granted or to be granted in the calendar year in which the non-compliance was detected. To ensure an effective and coherent approach by Member States, it is necessary to provide for a minimum penalty rate at Union level for non-compliance. Such minimum rates should be applied by Member States depending on the severity, extent, permanence or reoccurrence and intentionality of the non-compliance determined. To ensure proportionality of the penalties, Member States should provide that no penalties are to be applied where the non-compliance has no or only insignificant consequences for the achievement of the objective of the standard or requirement concerned, and set up an awareness mechanism to ensure that beneficiaries are informed about the non-compliance detected and possible remedial actions to be taken.</p>

That mechanism should remain independent from, and should not affect, the functioning of the particular social model of each Member State, nor should it in any way affect the independence of the judiciary.
