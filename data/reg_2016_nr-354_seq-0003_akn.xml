               <p>Rail transport has the potential to grow and increase its modal share and to play a major role in a sustainable transport and mobility system, creating new investment opportunities and jobs. However, the growth of passenger transport services by rail has not kept pace with the evolution of other modes of transport.</p>

               <p>The Union market for international passenger transport services by rail has been open to competition since 2010. In addition, some Member States have opened their domestic passenger services to competition, by introducing open access rights, or tendering for public service contracts, or both. The opening of the market for domestic passenger services by rail should have a positive impact on the functioning of the single European railway area, leading to better services for users.</p>
