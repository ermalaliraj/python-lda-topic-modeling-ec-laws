When disease prevention and control measures are carried out in accordance with this Regulation, their effect on animal welfare, understood in the light of Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), should be considered in order to spare the animals concerned any avoidable pain, distress or suffering.

               <p>Animals may suffer from a broad range of infectious or non&#45;infectious diseases. Many diseases can be treated, or have an impact only on the individual animal concerned, or do not spread to other animals or to humans. On the other hand, transmissible diseases may have a broader impact on animal or public health, with effects felt at population level. The animal health rules laid down in this Regulation should be limited to those latter diseases alone.</p>

               <p>Diseases occurring in animals which are kept by humans can have severe impacts on the agriculture and aquaculture sectors, on public health, on the environment and on biodiversity.

               <p>Nevertheless, diseases occurring in wild animal populations may have a detrimental effect on the agriculture and aquaculture sectors, on public health, on the environment and on biodiversity. It is therefore appropriate that the scope of this Regulation should, in such cases, cover wild animals, both as potential victims of those diseases and as their vectors.

               <p>Animal diseases are not only transmitted through direct contact between animals or between animals and humans. They are also carried further afield through water and air systems, vectors such as insects, or the semen, oocytes and embryos used in artificial insemination, oocyte donation or embryo transfer. Disease agents may also be contained in food and other products of animal origin such as leather, fur, feathers, horn and any other material derived from the body of an animal. Moreover, various other objects such as transport vehicles, equipment, fodder and hay and straw may diffuse disease agents. Therefore, effective animal health rules need to cover all paths of infection and material involved therein.</p>

Microorganisms causing such animal diseases can therefore be considered as invasive alien species within the framework of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. The measures provided for in this Regulation also take account of biodiversity and thus this Regulation should cover animal species and disease agents, including those defined as invasive animal species, which play a role in the transmission of, or are affected by, diseases covered by this Regulation.</p>

Yet in most cases, the main principles for good animal health governance and good animal husbandry are applicable to both groups of animal species. Accordingly, this Regulation should cover both terrestrial and aquatic animals and should align those animal health rules where applicable. However, for certain aspects, in particular the registration and approval of establishments and the traceability and movements of animals within the Union, this Regulation adheres to the approach adopted in the past, which was to lay down different sets of animal health rules for terrestrial and aquatic animals due to their different environments and accordingly different requirements to safeguard health.</p>

Usually, such species do not present a significant health risk for humans or other animals and therefore only a few animal health rules, if any, apply. In order to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens and costs, this Regulation should adhere to the approach adopted in the past, namely to provide the legal framework enabling detailed animal health rules to be laid down for movements of such animals and their products if the risks involved so require.</p>

               <p>Humans often keep certain animals as pets in their households to keep them company. The keeping of such pet animals for purely private purposes, including ornamental aquatic animals in households, both indoors and outdoors, generally poses a lower health risk compared to other ways of keeping or moving animals on a broader scale, such as those common in agriculture, aquaculture, animal shelters and the transport of animals more generally. Therefore, it is not appropriate that the general requirements concerning registration, record keeping and movements within the Union should apply to such pet animals, as this would represent an unjustified administrative burden and cost. Registration and record keeping requirements should therefore not apply to pet keepers. In addition, specific rules should apply to non&#45;commercial movements of pet animals within the Union.</p>

               <p>Antimicrobial resistance, understood as the ability of microorganisms to survive or to grow in the presence of a concentration of an antimicrobial agent which is usually sufficient to inhibit or kill microorganisms of the same species, is increasing. Action No 5 advocated in the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council entitled &apos;Action plan against the rising threats from antimicrobial resistance&apos; emphasises the preventive role to be played by this Regulation and the consequent expected reduction of the use of antibiotics in animals. This resistance of microorganisms to antimicrobials to which they were previously responsive complicates the treatment of infectious diseases in humans and animals and may thus pose a threat to human or animal health. As a result, microorganisms that have developed resistance to antimicrobials should be treated as if they were transmissible diseases, and thus covered by the scope of this Regulation.

Some highly contagious diseases which are currently not present in the Union require stringent measures to immediately eradicate them as soon as they occur. In cases where such diseases are not promptly eradicated and become endemic, a long-term compulsory eradication programme will be required. For other diseases that may already be present in parts of the Union, compulsory or optional eradication is required. In these cases, it is appropriate to put in place restrictions on movements of animals and products, such as a prohibition of movements to and from affected areas, or simply to test the animals or products concerned prior to dispatch.

               <p>Consequently, the principle explained in recital 142 should also apply to movements of aquatic animals that are not defined as aquaculture animals but are covered by the scope of this Regulation. This applies, in particular, to aquatic animals with an unknown or confirmed disease positive health status, regardless of their final use. As movements of live wild aquatic animals with an unknown or confirmed disease positive health status and intended for human consumption may also pose a risk of spreading listed or emerging diseases, the same system of rules should also apply to them. This includes those wild aquatic animals, harvested or caught for human consumption, which are moved and temporarily kept while awaiting slaughter.</p>

               <p>However, disproportionate movement restrictions and unnecessary administrative burdens for establishments and operators within the commercial fisheries sector should be avoided. Consequently, in cases where such live wild aquatic animals are intended for human consumption, the rules in question should in principle apply only to movements of live wild aquatic animals which pose a significant risk of spreading listed or emerging diseases into Member States, zones or compartments which have been declared free of certain listed diseases or which are subject to eradication programmes with regard to those diseases.</p>

               <p>Union aquaculture production is extremely diverse as regards species and production systems, and this diversification is rapidly increasing. This may require the adoption at Member State level of national measures concerning diseases other than those regarded as listed diseases in accordance with this Regulation.

Furthermore, they should not affect movements between Member States unless they are necessary in order to prevent the introduction, or to control the spread, of disease.

               <p>With a view to guaranteeing the reliability of the arrangements provided for in existing Regulations establishing systems for the identification and registration of bovine, ovine and caprine animals, that legislation requires the Member States to carry out adequate and efficient control measures. Such adequate and efficient official control measures should also be preserved in the future. As part of the &apos;Smarter rules for safer food&apos; package of proposals, this Regulation does not envisage provisions on official controls since those rules should be provided for in the framework of the proposed horizontal legislation on official controls. However, even if the proposed new horizontal rules on official controls were not to enter into force at the same time as this Regulation, the existing horizontal rules on official controls would allow the Commission to ensure an equivalent level of control.</p>

               <p>The rules laid down in the legislative acts referred to in recital 167 are to be replaced by this Regulation and by subsequent Commission acts to be adopted pursuant to this Regulation. Accordingly, those legislative acts should be repealed. However, to ensure legal clarity and avoid a legal vacuum, the repeal should in the first place take effect only when the relevant delegated and implementing acts are adopted pursuant to this Regulation. It is therefore necessary to empower the Commission to determine the dates when the repeal of those legislative acts is to take effect, while the legislator should set a deadline.</p>
