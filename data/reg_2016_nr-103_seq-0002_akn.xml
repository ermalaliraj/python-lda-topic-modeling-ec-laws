               <p>The milk and milk products sector is experiencing a prolonged period of severe market imbalance. While world import demand for milk and milk products remained stable overall in 2015 in comparison with 2014, production significantly increased in the Union and other main exporting regions.</p>

               <p>Investments in milk-production capacity in the Union, made in preparation for the expiry of milk quotas and in view of positive medium-term prospects on the world market, have resulted in steadily increasing milk production in the Union. Milk volumes produced in excess are processed into long-term storable products such as butter and skimmed milk powder.</p>

               <p>Prices of butter and skimmed milk powder in the Union consequently declined in the years 2014 and 2015, when the prices of skimmed milk powder hit the public intervention price. Butter prices are still above the public intervention price, but are under downward pressure.</p>
