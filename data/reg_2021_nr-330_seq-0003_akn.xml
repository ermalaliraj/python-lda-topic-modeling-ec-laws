For <i>Bacillus pumilus</i> QST 2808 and <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. strain DSMZ 13134, no specific MRLs were set in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 nor were those substances included in Annex IV to that Regulation, so the default value of 0,01 mg/kg laid down in Article 18(1)(b) thereof applies.</p>

               <p>As regards all applications, the Authority concluded that all requirements with respect to data were met and that the modifications to the MRLs requested by the applicants were acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups. It took into account the most recent information on the toxicological properties of the substances. Neither the lifetime exposure to these substances via consumption of all food products that may contain them, nor the short-term exposure due to high consumption of the relevant products showed that there is a risk that the acceptable daily intake or the acute reference dose is exceeded.</p>

               <p>For ethirimol, several MRLs were modified by Commission Regulation (EU) 2020/1566<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">
                     <p>Commission Regulation (EU) 2020/1566 of 27 October 2020 amending Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards maximum residue levels for bupirimate, carfentrazone-ethyl, ethirimol, and pyriofenone in or on certain products (OJ L 358, 28.10.2020, p. 30).</p>
                  </authorialNote>. That Regulation lowered the MRL for ethirimol in cucumbers to 0,05 mg/kg due to a reporting error. Ethirimol is the main metabolite of bupirimate, which is currently used in plant protection products in several Member States. As a consequence, the lowering of the MRL for ethirimol may result in potential MRL exceedances following the lawful use of bupirimate. To avoid this, the Rapporteur Member State submitted on 25 August 2020 an amended evaluation report to the Authority, who has published a correction to the relevant reasoned opinion on 30 September 2020<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">
                     <p>Reasoned opinion on the Review of the existing maximum residue levels for bupirimate according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. EFSA Journal 2019;17(7):5757.</p>
                  </authorialNote>, where it recommended setting the MRL for ethirimol in cucumbers at 0,2 mg/kg. In the interest of legal certainty, it is appropriate for the MRL for ethirimol in cucumbers, provided for by this Regulation, to apply from the same date as the date of application of Regulation (EU) 2020/1566.</p>
