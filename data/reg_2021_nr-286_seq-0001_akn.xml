               <p>On 18 March 2010, the European Food Safety Authority (&apos;the Authority&apos;) adopted an opinion on lead in food<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">
                     <p>EFSA CONTAM Panel (EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain), 2010. Scientific Opinion on lead in food. <i>EFSA Journal</i> 2010;8(4):1570, https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1570</p>
                  </authorialNote>. The Authority identified that lead can cause developmental neurotoxicity in young children and cardiovascular issues and nephrotoxicity in adults. The risk assessment for lead was based on these potentially critical adverse effects. The Authority concluded that there was no evidence for a threshold for a number of critical endpoints, including developmental neurotoxicity and adult nephrotoxicity. Therefore, it was not appropriate to derive a tolerable weekly intake. The Authority expressed a concern that there was potential that the current levels of dietary exposure to lead might affect neurodevelopment in foetuses, infants and children.</p>

               <p>Taking into account the most recent occurrence data, the Codex Alimentarius Commission at its 41th Session (&apos;CAC41&apos;) lowered the Codex maximum level for lead in salt (excluding salt from marshes) from 2 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg.</p>

               <p>Taking into account the most recent occurrence data, the Codex Alimentarius Commission at its 42nd Session (&apos;CAC42&apos;) lowered the Codex maximum levels of 0,5 mg/kg for edible offal to 0,2 mg/kg for edible offal from cattle, 0,15 mg/kg for edible offal from pigs and 0,1 mg/kg for edible offal from poultry. It also lowered the maximum levels for &apos;wine made from grapes&apos; from 0,2 mg/kg to 0,1 mg/kg and set a maximum level for fortified/liqueur &apos;wines made from grapes&apos; at 0,15 mg/kg. Both maximum levels apply to wine made from grapes harvested after the date the CAC42 adopted the maximum levels.</p>

               <p>In light of these developments and of the most recent occurrence data, the dietary exposure to lead in food should be reduced within the Union by lowering the existing maximum levels or setting additional maximum levels for foodstuffs for which lower levels of lead are reasonably achievable, namely offal, certain foods for infants and young children, salt and wild fungi. For the same reasons, the maximum levels for lead in wines should be reduced and a maximum level for liqueur wine should be established as regards those products produced from future harvests. Finally, for those same reasons, but also to help fight fraudulent practices, such as the addition of lead chromate to turmeric, maximum levels for spices should be established.</p>

               <p>Given that lead is a weak indirect genotoxic carcinogen, and consequently its presence is a higher risk for public health, products not complying with the new maximum levels for lead and placed on the market before the entry into force of this Regulation should only be allowed to remain on the market for a short period of time.</p>
