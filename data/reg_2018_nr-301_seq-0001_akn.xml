However, the test tolerance should not be exploited to obtain results different from those associated with the execution of the test at set-point conditions. Therefore, in order to provide a level playing field among different vehicle manufacturers and to ensure that the measured CO<sub>2</sub> and fuel consumption values are more in line with real life, a method to normalise the impact of specific test tolerances on CO<sub>2</sub> and fuel consumption test results should be introduced.</p>

               <p>Regulation (EU) 2016/646 introduced the requirement for the manufacturers to declare the use of auxiliary emission strategies. In addition, Regulation (EU) 2017/1154 increased the supervision of emission strategies by the type approval authorities. However, the application of those requirements has highlighted the need to harmonise the application of the rules on auxiliary emission strategies by the different type approval authorities. Therefore it is appropriate to lay down a common format for the extended documentation package and a common methodology for the assessment of auxiliary emission strategies.</p>

In both cases, the dynamometer shall be adjusted to simulate the operation of a vehicle on the road at &#45; 7 °C. Such adjustment may be based on a determination of the road load force profile at &#45; 7 °C. Alternatively, the driving resistance determined may be adjusted for a 10 % decrease of the coast-down time. The technical service may approve the use of other methods for determining the driving resistance.&apos;;</p>
