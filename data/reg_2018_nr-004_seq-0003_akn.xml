               <p>In the light of experience and following the assessment by the Commission on the functioning of the internal market for veterinary medicinal products, the regulatory framework for veterinary medicinal products should be adapted to scientific progress, the current market conditions and economic reality, while continuing to ensure a high level of protection of animal health, animal welfare and environment and safeguarding public health.</p>

               <p>The regulatory framework for veterinary medicinal products should take into account the needs of the businesses in the veterinary pharmaceutical sector and trade in veterinary medicinal products within the Union. It should also integrate the major policy objectives set out in the Communication from the Commission of 3 March 2010 entitled &apos;Europe 2020 A Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth&apos;.</p>

               <p>Experience has shown that the needs of the veterinary sector differ substantially from those of the human sector in relation to medicinal products. In particular, the drivers for investment in markets for medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products are different. For example, in the veterinary sector there are many different animal species, which creates both a fragmented market and the need for major investments in order to extend the authorisation of veterinary medicinal products existing for one animal species to another. Moreover, the price-setting mechanisms in the veterinary sector follow a completely different logic. Consequently, prices for veterinary medicinal products are typically substantially lower than for medicinal products for human use. The size of the animal pharmaceutical industry is only a small fraction of the size of the pharmaceutical industry for medicinal products for human use. It is therefore appropriate to develop a regulatory framework addressing the characteristics and specificities of the veterinary sector, which cannot be considered as a model for the market for medicinal products for human use.</p>

               <p>The identification of packs of veterinary medicinal products via identification codes is common practice in several Member States. Those Member States have developed integrated electronic systems at national level for the proper functioning of such codes, linked to national databases. The introduction of a harmonised Union-wide system has not been the subject of any assessment as to costs and administrative consequences. Instead, there should be a possibility for Member States to decide at national level on whether or not to adopt a system for identification codes to be added to the information on the outer packaging of the veterinary medicinal products.</p>

               <p>However, the existing systems for identification codes currently used at national level vary and there is no standard format. The possibility should be provided for the development of a harmonised identification code for which the Commission should adopt uniform rules. The adoption by the Commission of rules concerning such an identification code would not prevent Member States from being able to choose whether or not to use such an identification code.</p>

               <p>In spite of the measures that farmers and other operators are obliged to take on the basis of rules adopted at Union level regarding health of kept animals, good animal husbandry, good hygiene, feed, management and biosecurity, animals can suffer from a broad range of diseases which need to be prevented or treated by veterinary medicinal products for both animal health and welfare reasons. The impact of animal diseases and the measures necessary to control them can be devastating for individual animals, animal populations, animal keepers and the economy. Animal diseases transmissible to humans can also have a significant impact on public health. Therefore sufficient and effective veterinary medicinal products should be available in the Union in order to ensure high standards of public and animal health, and for the development of the agriculture and aquaculture sectors.</p>

               <p>To ensure the proper administration and appropriate dosing of certain veterinary medicinal products which are to be administered orally in feed or drinking water to animals, especially in the case of treatment of groups of animals, such administration should be properly described in the product information. Additional instructions for cleaning the equipment used for administration of those products should be set out to avoid cross-contamination and reduce antimicrobial resistance. In order to improve the effective and safe use of veterinary medicinal products authorised and prescribed for oral administration via routes other than medicated feed, such as mixing of water for drinking with a veterinary medicinal product or manual mixing of a veterinary medicinal product into feed and administered by the animal keeper to food-producing animals, the Commission should, where necessary, adopt delegated acts. The Commission should take into account scientific recommendations of the European Medicines Agency, established by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (&apos;the Agency&apos;), for example concerning measures to minimise over-dosage or under-dosage, unintended administration to non-target animals, the risk of cross-contamination and dissemination of those products in the environment.</p>

               <p>It is recognised that the potential effect of a product on the environment may depend on the volume used and the resulting amount of the pharmaceutical substance that may reach the environment. Therefore, where there is evidence that a constituent of a medicinal product, for which an application for a marketing authorisation for a generic veterinary medicinal product has been submitted, is a hazard for the environment, it is appropriate to require data on the potential effect on the environment in order to protect the environment. In such cases, applicants should endeavour to join efforts in generating such data in order to reduce costs and to reduce testing on vertebrate animals. The establishment of a single Union assessment of the environmental properties of active substances for veterinary use by means of an active substance-based review (&apos;monograph&apos;) system could be a potential alternative. The Commission should therefore submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council which examines the feasibility of such a monograph system and other potential alternatives for environmental risk assessment of veterinary medicinal products, accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal.</p>

               <p>Antimicrobial resistance to medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products is a growing health problem in the Union and worldwide. Due to the complexity of the problem, its cross-border dimension and the high economic burden, its impact goes beyond its severe consequences for human and animal health and has become a global public health concern that affects the whole of society and requires urgent and coordinated intersectoral action in accordance with the &apos;One Health&apos; approach. Such action includes strengthening of the prudent use of antimicrobials, avoiding their routine prophylactic and metaphylactic use, actions to restrict the use in animals of antimicrobials that are of critical importance for preventing or treating life-threatening infections in humans and encouraging and incentivising the development of new antimicrobials. It also needs to be ensured that appropriate warnings and guidance are included on the labels of veterinary antimicrobials. Use that is not covered by the terms of the marketing authorisation of certain new or critically important antimicrobials for humans should be restricted in the veterinary sector. The rules for advertising veterinary antimicrobials should be tightened, and the authorisation requirements should sufficiently address the risks and benefits of antimicrobial veterinary medicinal products.</p>

               <p>It is necessary to mitigate the risk of development of antimicrobial resistance to medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products. Therefore, an application for an antimicrobial veterinary medicinal product should contain information about the potential risks that use of that medicinal product may lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance in humans or animals or in organisms associated with them. In order to ensure a high level of public and animal health, antimicrobial veterinary medicinal products should only be authorised following a careful scientific benefit-risk assessment. If necessary, conditions should be laid down in the marketing authorisation in order to restrict the use of the veterinary medicinal product. Such conditions should include restrictions on the use of the veterinary medicinal product that is not in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorisation, in particular with the summary of product characteristics.</p>

               <p>The combined use of several antimicrobial active substances may represent a particular risk with respect to the development of antimicrobial resistance.

               <p>The development of new antimicrobials has not kept pace with the increase of resistance to existing antimicrobials. Given the limited innovation in developing new antimicrobials, it is essential that the efficacy of existing antimicrobials be maintained for as long as possible. The use of antimicrobials in medicinal products that are used in animals may accelerate the emergence and spread of resistant micro-organisms and may compromise the effective use of the already limited number of existing antimicrobials to treat human infections. Therefore, the misuse of antimicrobials should not be allowed. Antimicrobial medicinal products should not be used for prophylaxis other than in well-defined cases for the administration to an individual animal or restricted number of animals when the risk for infection is very high or its consequences are likely to be severe. Antibiotic medicinal products should not be used for prophylaxis other than in exceptional cases only for the administration to an individual animal. Antimicrobial medicinal products should be used for metaphylaxis only when the risk of spread of an infection or of an infectious disease in a group of animals is high and where no appropriate alternatives are available. Such restrictions should allow the decrease of prophylactic and metaphylactic use in animals towards representing a smaller proportion of the total use of antimicrobials in animals.</p>

It should be possible, therefore, to decide that certain antimicrobials, following the scientific recommendations of the Agency, should not be available on the market in the veterinary sector. When making such decisions on antimicrobials, the Commission should also take into account available recommendations on the matter provided for by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and other relevant Union agencies, which in turn also take into account any relevant recommendations from international organisations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and the Codex Alimentarius.</p>

               <p>If an antimicrobial is administered or used incorrectly, this presents a risk to public or animal health. Therefore, antimicrobial veterinary medicinal products should only be available on veterinary prescription. Veterinarians have a key role in ensuring prudent use of antimicrobials and consequently they should prescribe the antimicrobial medicinal products based on their knowledge of antimicrobial resistance, their epidemiological and clinical knowledge and their understanding of the risk factors for the individual animal or group of animals. In addition, the veterinarians should respect their professional code of conduct. Veterinarians should ensure that they are not in a situation of conflict of interest when prescribing medicinal products, while recognising their legitimate activity of retail in accordance with national law. In particular, veterinarians should not to be influenced, directly or indirectly, by economic incentives when prescribing those medicinal products. Furthermore, the supply of veterinary medicinal products by veterinarians should be restricted to the amount required for treatment of the animals under their care.</p>

               <p>The prudent use of antimicrobials is a cornerstone in addressing antimicrobial resistance. All the stakeholders concerned should together promote prudent use of antimicrobials. It is therefore important that guidance on the prudent use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine be taken into account and further elaborated. The identification of risk factors and the development of criteria for the initiation of administration of antimicrobials, as well as the identification of alternative measures, could help in avoiding the unnecessary use of antimicrobial medicinal products, including through metaphylaxis.

               <p>It is important to consider the international dimension of the development of antimicrobial resistance when assessing the benefit-risk balance of certain veterinary antimicrobials in the Union. Antimicrobial resistant organisms can spread to humans and animals in the Union and third countries through consumption of products of animal origin from the Union or from third countries, from direct contact with animals or humans or by other means. Therefore, measures restricting the use of veterinary antimicrobials in the Union should be based on scientific advice and should be considered in the context of cooperation with third countries and international organisations. For those reasons, it should also be ensured, in a non-discriminatory and proportionate manner, that operators in third countries respect certain basic conditions relating to antimicrobial resistance for animals and products of animal origin exported to the Union. Any such action should respect Union obligations under relevant international agreements. This should contribute to the international fight against antimicrobial resistance, in particular in line with the WHO Global Action Plan and the OIE Strategy on Antimicrobial Resistance and the Prudent Use of Antimicrobials.</p>

It is therefore important to continue the collection of such data and further develop it in line with a stepwise approach. That data, when available, should be analysed with data on the use of antimicrobials in humans and data on antimicrobial resistant organisms found in animals, humans and food. To ensure that the data collected can be used effectively, appropriate technical rules should be laid down concerning the collection and the exchange of data. The Member States should be responsible for collecting data on the sales and use of antimicrobials used in animals under the coordination of the Agency.

               <p>The conditions governing the supply of veterinary medicinal products to the public should be harmonised in the Union. Veterinary medicinal products should only be supplied by persons authorised to do so by the Member State in which they are established. At the same time, in order to improve access to veterinary medicinal products in the Union, retailers that are authorised to supply veterinary medicinal products by the competent authority in the Member State in which they are established should be allowed to sell veterinary medicinal products not subject to a veterinary prescription at a distance to buyers in other Member States. However, taking into account that in some Member States it is current practice to sell at a distance also those veterinary medicinal products which are subject to prescription, Member States should be allowed to continue such practice under certain conditions and within their territory only. In such cases, those Member States should take appropriate measures to avoid unintended consequences of such supply and establish rules on appropriate penalties.</p>

               <p>The illegal sale of veterinary medicinal products to the public at a distance may represent a threat to public and animal health, as falsified or substandard medicines may reach the public in this way. It is necessary to address that threat. Account should be taken of the fact that specific conditions for supply of medicinal products to the public have not been harmonised at Union level and, therefore, Member States can impose conditions for supplying medicinal products to the public within the limits of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).</p>

               <p>When examining the compatibility with Union law of the conditions for the supply of medicinal products, the Court of Justice has recognised, in the context of medicinal products for human use, the very particular nature of medicinal products whose therapeutic effects distinguish them substantially from other goods. The Court of Justice has also held that health and life of humans rank foremost among the assets and interests protected by the TFEU and that it is for Member States to determine the level of protection which they wish to afford to public health and the way in which that level has to be achieved. Since that level may vary from one Member State to another, Member States are to be allowed some discretion as regards the conditions for the supply on their territory of medicinal products to the public. Member States should be able, therefore, to subject the supply of medicinal products offered for sale at a distance by means of information society services to conditions justified by the protection of public or animal health. Such conditions should not unduly restrict the functioning of the internal market. In that context, Member States should be able to subject the supply of veterinary medicinal products offered for retail to stricter conditions justified by the protection of public or animal health or of environment, provided that those conditions are proportionate to the risk and do not unduly restrict the functioning of the internal market.</p>

               <p>Advertising, even of medicinal products not subject to a veterinary prescription, could affect public and animal health and distort competition. Therefore, advertising of veterinary medicinal products should meet certain criteria. Persons qualified to prescribe or supply veterinary medicinal products can properly evaluate the information available in advertising because of their knowledge, training and experience in animal health. The advertising of veterinary medicinal products to persons who cannot properly assess the risk associated with their use may lead to medicinal product misuse or overconsumption which is liable to harm public or animal health, or the environment. However, in order to preserve the animal health status in their territory, Member States should be able under restricted conditions to allow advertising of immunological veterinary medicinal products also to professional animal keepers.</p>
