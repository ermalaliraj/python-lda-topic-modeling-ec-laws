               <p>The Union and the United States of America (the &apos;United States&apos;) have the largest and deepest bilateral trade and investment relationship in the world and have highly integrated economies. The two-way trade in goods and services between them is worth over EUR 1 trillion per year, which is approximately EUR 3000 million per day. That close trade and investment relationship is beneficial for consumers, workers, businesses and investors.</p>

               <p>The Union is committed to improving its trade and investment relationship with the United States. This includes finding new ways to improve the bilateral trade relationship, to address trade irritants and to resolve ongoing trade disputes. To avoid further disruption of that trade relationship, the customs duties applied by the Union to imports should be eliminated for a limited number of goods for a period of five years on an <i>erga omnes</i> basis.</p>
