               <p>This Regulation constitutes an essential step towards the completion of the Capital Markets Union as set out in the Communication of the Commission of 30 September 2015, entitled &apos;Action Plan on Building a Capital Markets Union&apos;. The aim of the Capital Markets Union is to help businesses tap into more diverse sources of capital from anywhere within the European Union (&apos;the Union&apos;), make markets work more efficiently and offer investors and savers additional opportunities to put their money to work, in order to enhance growth and create jobs.</p>

                  </authorialNote> laid down harmonised principles and rules on the prospectus to be drawn up, approved and published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market. Given the legislative and market developments since its entry into force, that Directive should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation.</p>

               <p>Disclosure of information in cases of offers of securities to the public or admission of securities to trading on a regulated market is vital to protect investors by removing asymmetries of information between them and issuers. Harmonising such disclosure allows for the establishment of a cross-border passport mechanism which facilitates the effective functioning of the internal market in a wide variety of securities.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d62e136">
               <num>(4)</num>
               <p>Divergent approaches would result in fragmentation of the internal market since issuers, offerors and persons asking for admission to trading on a regulated market would be subject to different rules in different Member States and prospectuses approved in one Member State could be prevented from being used in other Member States. In the absence of a harmonised framework to ensure uniformity of disclosure and the functioning of the passport in the Union it is therefore likely that differences in Member States&apos; laws would create obstacles to the smooth functioning of the internal market for securities. Therefore, to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and improve the conditions of its functioning, in particular with regard to capital markets, and to guarantee a high level of consumer and investor protection, it is appropriate to lay down a regulatory framework for prospectuses at Union level.</p>

               <p>It is appropriate and necessary for the rules on disclosure when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market to take the legislative form of a regulation in order to ensure that provisions directly imposing obligations on persons involved in offers of securities to the public and in admissions of securities to trading on a regulated market are applied in a uniform manner throughout the Union. Since a legal framework for the provisions on prospectuses necessarily involves measures specifying precise requirements for all different aspects inherent to prospectuses, even small divergences on the approach taken regarding one of those aspects could result in significant impediments to cross-border offers of securities, to multiple listings on regulated markets and to Union consumer protection rules. Therefore, the use of a regulation, which is directly applicable without requiring national law, should reduce the possibility of divergent measures being taken at national level, and should ensure a consistent approach, greater legal certainty and prevent such significant impediments. The use of a regulation will also strengthen confidence in the transparency of markets across the Union, and reduce regulatory complexity as well as search and compliance costs for companies.</p>

               <p>The assessment of Directive 2010/73/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5">
                     <p>Directive 2010/73/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 amending Directives 2003/71/EC on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and 2004/109/EC on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market (OJ L 327, 11.12.2010, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote> has revealed that certain changes introduced by that Directive have not met their original objectives and that further amendments to the prospectus regime in the Union are necessary to simplify and improve its application, increase its efficiency and enhance the international competitiveness of the Union, thereby contributing to the reduction of administrative burdens.</p>

               <p>The aim of this Regulation is to ensure investor protection and market efficiency, while enhancing the internal market for capital. The provision of information which, according to the nature of the issuer and of the securities, is necessary to enable investors to make an informed investment decision ensures, together with rules on the conduct of business, the protection of investors. Moreover, such information provides an effective means of increasing confidence in securities and thus of contributing to the proper functioning and development of securities markets. The appropriate way to make that information available is to publish a prospectus.</p>

               <p>The disclosure requirements of this Regulation do not prevent a Member State or a competent authority or an exchange, through its rulebook, from imposing other particular requirements in the context of the admission to trading of securities on a regulated market, notably regarding corporate governance. Such requirements should not directly or indirectly restrict the drawing up, the content and the dissemination of a prospectus approved by a competent authority.</p>

               <p>The obligation to publish a prospectus should apply to both equity and non-equity securities offered to the public or admitted to trading on regulated markets in order to ensure investor protection. Some of the securities covered by this Regulation entitle the holder to acquire transferable securities or to receive a cash amount through a cash settlement determined by reference to other instruments, notably transferable securities, currencies, interest rates or yields, commodities or other indices or measures. This Regulation covers in particular warrants, covered warrants, certificates, depositary receipts and convertible notes, such as securities convertible at the option of the investor.</p>

               <p>To ensure the approval and passporting of the prospectus as well as the supervision of compliance with this Regulation, a competent authority needs to be identified for each prospectus.

               <p>For offers of securities to the public with a total consideration in the Union of less than EUR 1000000, the cost of producing a prospectus in accordance with this Regulation is likely to be disproportionate to the envisaged proceeds of the offer. It is therefore appropriate that the obligation to draw up a prospectus under this Regulation should not apply to offers of such small scale. Member States should not extend the obligation to draw up a prospectus in accordance with this Regulation to offers of securities to the public with a total consideration below that threshold. However, Member States should be able to require other disclosure requirements at national level to the extent that such requirements do not constitute a disproportionate or unnecessary burden in relation to such offers of securities.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, in view of the varying sizes of financial markets across the Union, it is appropriate to give Member States the option of exempting offers of securities to the public not exceeding EUR 8000000 from the obligation to publish a prospectus as provided for in this Regulation. In particular, Member States should be free to set out in their national law a threshold between EUR 1000000 and EUR 8000000, expressed as the total consideration of the offer in the Union over a period of 12 months, below which the exemption should apply taking into account the level of domestic investor protection they deem to be appropriate. However, such exempted offers of securities to the public should not benefit from the passporting regime under this Regulation. Below that threshold, Member States should be able to require other disclosure requirements at national level to the extent that such requirements do not constitute a disproportionate or unnecessary burden in relation to such exempted offers of securities. Nothing in this Regulation should prevent those Member States from introducing rules at national level which allow the operators of multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) to determine the content of the admission document which an issuer is required to produce upon initial admission to trading of its securities or the modalities of its review.</p>

               <p>The mere admission of securities to trading on a MTF or the publication of bid and offer prices is not to be regarded in itself as an offer of securities to the public and is therefore not subject to the obligation to draw up a prospectus under this Regulation.

               <p>Where an offer of securities is addressed exclusively to a restricted circle of investors who are not qualified investors, drawing up a prospectus represents a disproportionate burden in view of the small number of persons targeted by the offer, thus no prospectus should be required.

               <p>Incentivising directors and employees to hold securities of their own company can have a positive impact on companies&apos; governance and help create long-term value by fostering employees&apos; dedication and sense of ownership, aligning the respective interests of shareholders and employees, and providing the latter with investment opportunities. Participation of employees in the ownership of their company is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in which individual employees are likely to play a significant role in the success of the company. Therefore, there should be no obligation to publish a prospectus for offers made in the context of an employee-share scheme within the Union, provided a document is made available containing information on the number and nature of the securities and the reasons for and details of the offer or allotment, to safeguard investor protection. To ensure equal access to employee-share schemes for all directors and employees, independently of whether their employer is established in or outside the Union, no equivalence decision of third country markets should be required any longer, as long as such information document is made available. Thus, all participants in employee-share schemes will benefit from equal treatment and information.</p>

               <p>Dilutive issuances of shares or securities giving access to shares often indicate transactions with a significant impact on the issuer&apos;s capital structure, prospects and financial situation, for which the information contained in a prospectus is needed. In contrast, where an issuer has shares already admitted to trading on a regulated market, a prospectus should not be required for any subsequent admission of the shares of the same class on the same regulated market, including where such shares result from the conversion or exchange of other securities or from the exercise of the rights conferred by other securities, provided that the newly admitted shares represent a limited proportion in relation to shares of the same class already admitted to the same regulated market, unless such admission is combined with an offer of securities to the public falling within the scope of this Regulation. The same principle should apply more generally to securities fungible with securities already admitted to trading on a regulated market.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure the proper functioning of the wholesale market for non-equity securities and increase market liquidity, it is important to set out a distinct alleviated treatment for non-equity securities admitted to trading on a regulated market and designed for qualified investors. Such alleviated treatment should comprise minimum information requirements that are less onerous than those applying to non-equity securities offered to retail investors, no requirement to include a summary in the prospectus, and more flexible language requirements. The alleviated treatment should be applicable to, firstly, non-equity securities, regardless of their denomination, which are traded only on a regulated market, or a specific segment thereof, to which only qualified investors can have access for the purposes of trading in such securities and, secondly, to non-equity securities with a denomination per unit of at least EUR 100000, which reflects the higher investment capacity of the investors concerned by the prospectus. No resale to non-qualified investors should be allowed for non-equity securities that are traded only on a regulated market, or a specific segment thereof, to which only qualified investors can have access for the purposes of trading in such securities, unless a prospectus is drawn up in accordance with this Regulation that is appropriate for non-qualified investors. To that end, it is essential that market operators, when establishing such regulated markets, or a specific segment thereof, do not allow direct or indirect access by non-qualified investors to that regulated market or specific segment.</p>

               <p>Frequent issuers should be incentivised to draw up their prospectus as separate documents, since that can reduce their cost of compliance with this Regulation and enable them to swiftly react to market windows. Thus, issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on regulated markets or MTFs should have the option, but not the obligation, to draw up and publish every financial year a universal registration document containing legal, business, financial, accounting and shareholding information and providing a description of the issuer for that financial year. On the condition that an issuer fulfils the criteria set out in this Regulation, the issuer should be deemed to be a frequent issuer as from the moment when the issuer submits the universal registration document for approval to the competent authority. Drawing up a universal registration document should enable the issuer to keep the information up-to-date and to draw up a prospectus when market conditions become favourable for an offer of securities to the public or an admission to trading on a regulated market by adding a securities note and a summary. The universal registration document should be multi-purpose insofar as its content should be the same irrespective of whether the issuer subsequently uses it for an offer of securities to the public or an admission to trading on a regulated market of equity or non-equity securities. Therefore, the disclosure standards for the universal registration document should be based on those for equity securities. The universal registration document should act as a source of reference on the issuer, supplying investors and analysts with the minimum information needed to make an informed judgement on the company&apos;s business, financial position, earnings and prospects, governance and shareholding.</p>

               <p>One of the core objectives of the Capital Markets Union is to facilitate access to financing on capital markets for SMEs in the Union. It is appropriate to extend the definition of SMEs to include SMEs as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU to ensure consistency between this Regulation and Directive 2014/65/EU. As SMEs usually need to raise relatively lower amounts than other issuers, the cost of drawing up a standard prospectus can be disproportionately high and might deter them from offering their securities to the public. At the same time, because of their size and potentially shorter track record, SMEs might carry a specific investment risk compared to larger issuers and should disclose sufficient information for investors to take their investment decision. Furthermore, in order to encourage the use of capital market financing by SMEs, this Regulation should ensure that special consideration is given to SME growth markets, which are a promising tool to allow smaller, growing companies to raise capital. The success of such venues depends, however, on their ability to cater for the financing needs of growing SMEs. Similarly, certain companies offering securities to the public with a total consideration in the Union not exceeding EUR 20000000 would benefit from easier access to capital market financing in order to be able to grow and should be able to raise funds at costs that are not disproportionately high. Therefore, it is appropriate that this Regulation establishes a specific proportionate EU Growth prospectus regime which is available to such companies. A proper balance should be struck between cost-efficient access to financial markets and investor protection when calibrating the content of an EU Growth prospectus. As is the case for other types of prospectus under this Regulation, once approved, an EU Growth prospectus should benefit from the passporting regime under this Regulation and should therefore be valid for any offer of securities to the public across the Union.</p>

Issuers whose securities are traded on an MTF, and issuers which are exempted from publishing annual and half-yearly financial reports pursuant to point (b) of Article 8(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC, should also be allowed to incorporate by reference in a prospectus all or part of their annual and interim financial information, audit reports, financial statements, management reports or corporate governance statements, subject to their electronic publication.</p>

               <p>Not all issuers have access to adequate information and guidance about the scrutiny and approval process and the necessary steps to follow to get a prospectus approved, as different approaches by competent authorities exist in Member States. This Regulation should eliminate those differences by harmonising the criteria for the scrutiny of the prospectus and harmonising the rules applying to the approval processes of competent authorities by streamlining them. It is important to ensure that all competent authorities take a convergent approach when scrutinising the completeness, consistency and comprehensibility of the information contained in a prospectus taking into account the need for a proportionate approach in the scrutiny of prospectuses based on the circumstances of the issuer and of the issuance. Guidance on how to seek the approval of a prospectus should be publicly available on the websites of the competent authorities. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should play a key role in fostering supervisory convergence in that field by using its powers under Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="12">

               <p>Since the internet ensures easy access to information, and in order to ensure better accessibility for investors, the approved prospectus should always be published in an electronic form. The prospectus should be published on a dedicated section of the website of the issuer, the offeror or the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market, or, where applicable, on the website of the financial intermediaries placing or selling the securities, including paying agents, or on the website of the regulated market where the admission to trading is sought, or of the operator of the MTF.</p>

               <p>All prospectuses approved, or alternatively a list of those prospectuses with hyperlinks to the relevant dedicated website sections, should be published on the website of the competent authority of the issuer&apos;s home Member State, and each prospectus should be transmitted by the competent authority to ESMA along with the relevant data enabling its classification. ESMA should provide a centralised storage mechanism of prospectuses allowing access free of charge and appropriate search facilities for the public. To ensure that investors have access to reliable data that can be used and analysed in a timely and efficient matter, certain information contained in the prospectuses, such as the ISINs identifying the securities and the legal entity identifiers (LEIs) identifying the issuers, offerors and guarantors, should be machine readable including when meta data is used. Prospectuses should remain publicly available for at least 10 years after their publication, to ensure that their period of public availability is aligned with that of annual and half-yearly financial reports under Directive 2004/109/EC. Prospectuses should always be available to investors on a durable medium, free of charge, upon request. Where a potential investor makes a specific demand for a paper copy, that investor should be able to receive a printed version of the prospectus. However, that does not require the issuer, the offeror, the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market or the financial intermediary to keep in reserve printed copies of the prospectus to satisfy such potential requests.</p>

               <p>It is also necessary to harmonise advertisements in order to avoid undermining public confidence and prejudicing the proper functioning of financial markets. The fairness and accuracy of advertisements, as well as their consistency with the content of the prospectus are of utmost importance for the protection of investors, including retail investors. Without prejudice to the passporting regime under this Regulation, the supervision of such advertisements is an integral part of the role of competent authorities. The requirements on advertisements in this Regulation should be without prejudice to other applicable provisions of Union law, in particular relating to consumer protection and unfair commercial practices.</p>

               <p>Any significant new factor, material mistake or material inaccuracy which could influence the assessment of the investment, arising after the publication of the prospectus but before the closing of the offer or the start of trading on a regulated market, should be properly evaluated by investors and, therefore, requires the approval and dissemination of a supplement to the prospectus without undue delay.</p>

               <p>In order to improve legal certainty, the respective time limits within which an issuer is to publish a supplement to the prospectus and within which investors have a right to withdraw their acceptance of the offer following the publication of a supplement should be clarified. On the one hand, the obligation to supplement a prospectus should apply when the significant new factor, material mistake or material inaccuracy occurs before the closing of the offer period or the time when trading of such securities on a regulated market begins, whichever occurs later. On the other hand, the right to withdraw an acceptance should apply only where the prospectus relates to an offer of securities to the public and the significant new factor, material mistake or material inaccuracy arose or was noted before the closing of the offer period and the delivery of the securities. Hence, the right of withdrawal should be linked to the timing of the significant new factor, material mistake or material inaccuracy that gives rise to a supplement, and should apply provided that such triggering event has occurred while the offer is open and before the securities are delivered. The right of withdrawal granted to investors owing to a significant new factor, material mistake or material inaccuracy that arose or was noted during the validity period of a prospectus is not affected by the fact that the corresponding supplement is published after the validity period of that prospectus. In the particular case of an offer that continues under two successive base prospectuses, the fact that the issuer is in the process of having a succeeding base prospectus approved does not remove the obligation to supplement the previous base prospectus until the end of its validity and grant the associated rights of withdrawal. To improve legal certainty, the supplement to the prospectus should specify when the right of withdrawal ends. Financial intermediaries should inform investors of their rights and facilitate proceedings when investors exert their right to withdraw acceptances.</p>

               <p>The Commission should, by 21 July 2022, review the application of this Regulation and assess in particular whether the disclosure regimes for secondary issuances and for the EU Growth prospectus, the universal registration document and the prospectus summary remain appropriate to meet the objectives pursued by this Regulation. In particular, the report should analyse the relevant figures and trends concerning the EU Growth prospectus and assess whether the new regime strikes a proper balance between investor protection and the reduction of administrative burdens for the companies entitled to use it. Such a review should also assess whether issuers, in particular SMEs, can obtain LEIs and ISINs at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable period.</p>
