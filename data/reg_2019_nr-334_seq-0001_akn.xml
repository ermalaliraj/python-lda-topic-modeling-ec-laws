               <p>Following the financial crisis and the recommendations of a group of high-level experts led by Jacques de Larosi√®re, the Union has made important progress in creating not only stronger, but also more harmonised rules for the financial markets in the form of the Single Rulebook. The Union has also set up the European system of financial supervision (ESFS), built on a two-pillar system which combines micro-prudential supervision, coordinated by the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), and macro-prudential supervision through the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). The three ESAs, namely the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA) established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">

               <p>The ESAs have made a crucial contribution to the harmonisation of the rules of the financial markets in the Union by providing the Commission with input for its initiatives for regulations and directives adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council.

               <p>Enhanced powers afforded to the ESAs, to enable them to meet their objective, would also require appropriate governance, an efficient use of resources and sufficient funding.

               <p>When performing their tasks and exercising their powers, the ESAs should act in accordance with the principle of proportionality laid down in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), as well as with the better regulation policy. The content and form of the ESAs&apos; actions and measures including instruments such as guidelines, recommendations, opinions or questions and answers should always be based on and within the boundaries of the legislative acts referred to in Article 1(2) of the founding regulations or within the scope of their powers. The ESAs should not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Regulation and should act proportionately to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in the financial activity or business of the affected financial institution or undertaking.</p>

               <p>In its Communication of 8 June 2017 on the mid-term review of the Capital Markets Union Action Plan, the Commission emphasised that more effective and consistent supervision of financial markets and services is pivotal for the elimination of regulatory arbitrage between Member States in the exercise of their supervisory tasks, in order to accelerate market integration and to create internal market opportunities for financial entities and investors.</p>

               <p>Further progress in supervisory convergence is therefore particularly urgent to complete the capital markets union. Ten years after the onset of the financial crisis and the establishment of the new supervisory system, financial services and the capital markets union will be increasingly driven by two major developments: sustainable finance and technological innovation. Both have the potential to transform financial services and our system of financial supervision should be equipped for them. It is therefore crucial that the financial system plays its full part in meeting critical sustainability challenges. This will require active contribution by the ESAs to create the appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework.</p>

               <p>The ESAs should play an important role in identifying and reporting risks that environmental, social and governance related factors pose to financial stability, and in rendering financial markets activity more consistent with sustainability objectives. The ESAs should provide guidance on how sustainability considerations can be effectively embodied in relevant Union financial legislation and promote coherent implementation of those provisions upon adoption. When initiating and coordinating Union-wide assessments of the resilience of financial institutions to adverse market developments, the ESAs should duly consider risks that environmental, social and governance related factors could pose to the financial stability of those institutions.</p>

               <p>Technological innovation has had an increasing impact on the financial sector and competent authorities have therefore taken various initiatives to deal with those technological developments. In order to continue promoting supervisory convergence and to exchange best practices between relevant authorities on the one hand, and between relevant authorities and financial institutions or financial market participants on the other hand, the role of the ESAs with regard to their oversight function and supervisory coordination should be strengthened.</p>

               <p>Technological advancements in financial markets can improve financial inclusion, provide access to finance, enhance market integrity and operational efficiency and also lower barriers to entry in those markets. To the extent relevant for the applicable substantive rules, training of competent authorities should also extend to technological innovation.

               <p>It is becoming increasingly important to promote consistent, systematic and effective monitoring and assessment of risks in relation to money laundering and terrorist financing in the Union&apos;s financial system. The prevention and countering of money laundering and of terrorist financing is a shared responsibility of Member States and Union institutions and bodies, within their respective mandates. They should establish mechanisms for enhanced cooperation, coordination and mutual assistance, fully utilising all the tools and measures available under the existing regulatory and institutional framework.</p>

               <p>Given the consequences for financial stability which may stem from abuses of the financial sector for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes, considering that it is in the banking sector that money laundering and terrorist financing risks are most likely to have systemic impact, and building on the experience already gained by EBA, which is an authority where the national competent authorities of all Member States are represented, in protecting the banking sector from such abuses, EBA should take a leading, coordinating and monitoring role at Union level to prevent the use of the financial system for such purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to entrust EBA, in addition to its current competences, with the power to act within the scope of Regulations (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010 insofar as such power relates to the prevention and countering of money laundering or of terrorist financing where it concerns financial sector operators and the competent authorities supervising them, which are covered by those Regulations. Moreover, concentrating that mandate for the entire financial sector within EBA would optimise the use of its expertise and resources, and would be without prejudice to the material obligations laid down in Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="7">

               <p>In order for EBA to exercise its mandate effectively, it should make full use of all its powers and tools under Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 while respecting the principle of proportionality. For that purpose, it should develop regulatory and supervisory standards, in particular by developing draft regulatory technical standards, draft implementing technical standards, guidelines and recommendations, and providing opinions for preventing and countering money laundering and terrorist financing in the financial sector and promoting their consistent implementation in line with the mandate provided for in the relevant legislative acts referred to in Article 1(2) and Article 16 of the founding regulations. The measures that EBA adopts to promote integrity, transparency and security in the financial system and to prevent and counter money laundering and terrorist financing should not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Regulation or of the legislative acts referred to in Article 1(2) of the founding regulations and should take duly into account the nature, scale and complexity of risks, business practices, business models and the size of financial sector operators and of markets.</p>

               <p>EBA should not collect information on concrete suspicious transactions which financial sector operators are obliged to report to EU Financial Intelligence Units in their Member States pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/849. Weaknesses should be considered material where they constitute a breach or a potential breach by a financial sector operator, or constitute inappropriate or ineffective application by a financial sector operator, or inappropriate or ineffective application by a financial sector operator of its internal policies and procedures to comply with the legal provisions related to the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering or terrorist financing. A breach is considered to have occurred where a financial sector operator fails to comply with the requirements of any Union act and of national law transposing such requirements referred to in Article 1(2) of the founding regulations to the extent that those acts contribute to the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering or terrorist financing. A potential breach is where the competent authority has reasonable grounds to suspect that a breach has occurred, but at that stage is not in a position to finally conclude that it has occurred. However, due to the information obtained at that stage such as information from on-site inspections or off-site proceedings, it is very likely that a breach has occurred. Inappropriate or ineffective application of legal provisions is constituted by the failure of a financial sector operator to implement the requirements of those acts in a satisfactory manner. Inappropriate or ineffective application of a financial sector operator&apos;s internal policies and procedures aiming at ensuring compliance with those acts should be considered as constituting a weakness substantially raising the risk that breaches have occurred or can occur.</p>

               <p>Harmonised supervision of the financial sector requires a consistent approach among competent authorities. To that end, the activities of the competent authorities are subject to peer reviews. The ESAs should also ensure that the methodology is applied in the same manner. Such peer reviews should not only focus on the convergence of supervisory practices, but also on the capacity of competent authorities to achieve high-quality supervisory outcomes, as well as on the independence of those competent authorities. The main findings of those peer reviews should be published to encourage compliance and increase transparency, unless such publication would involve risks to financial stability.</p>

               <p>In line with the objective of achieving a more coherent and viable supervisory system in the Union to prevent and counter money laundering and terrorist financing, the Commission should, after consulting all relevant authorities and stakeholders, conduct a comprehensive assessment of the implementation, functioning and effectiveness of the specific tasks conferred on EBA under this Regulation related to preventing and countering money laundering and terrorist financing. In particular, the assessment should &#45; to the extent possible &#45; reflect experience gained from situations where EBA requests a competent authority to: investigate possible breaches of national laws to the extent that they transpose Directives or exercise options to Member States by Union law by financial sector operators; consider imposing sanctions on that operator in respect of such breaches; or consider adopting an individual decision addressed to that financial sector operator requiring it to undertake all necessary action to comply with its obligations under national laws to the extent that they transpose Directives or exercise options granted to Member States by Union law. It should similarly reflect such experience where EBA applies national law to the extent it transposes Directives or exercises options granted to Member States by Union law. The Commission should submit that assessment as part of its report pursuant to Article 65 of Directive (EU) 2015/849, together with legislative proposals, if appropriate, to the European Parliament and to the Council by 11 January 2022.

Where necessary, it may also request a competent authority as referred to in point (2)(iii) of Article 4 to consider adopting an individual decision addressed to that financial sector operator requiring it to undertake all necessary action to comply with its obligations under directly applicable Union law, or under national law to the extent that it transposes Directives or exercises options granted to Member States by Union law, including the cessation of any practice. The requests referred to in this paragraph shall not impede ongoing supervisory measures by the competent authority to which the request is addressed.</p>

The follow-up report shall include an assessment of, but shall not be limited to, the adequacy and effectiveness of the actions undertaken by the competent authorities that are subject to the peer review in response to the follow-up measures of the peer review report.</p>

The Authority shall publish the reasoned main findings of the peer review and of the follow-up report referred to in paragraph 6. Where the reasoned main findings of the Authority differ from those identified by the peer review committee, the Authority shall transmit, on a confidential basis, the peer review committee&apos;s findings to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission. Where a competent authority that is subject to the peer review is concerned that the publication of the Authority&apos;s reasoned main findings would pose a risk to the stability of the financial system, it shall have the possibility to refer the matter to the Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors may decide not to publish those extracts.</p>

Those follow-up measures may be adopted in the form of guidelines and recommendations pursuant to Article 16 and opinions pursuant to point (a) of Article 29(1).</p>
