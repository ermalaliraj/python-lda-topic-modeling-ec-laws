               <p>In line with Regulation (EC) No 715/2009, it is necessary to establish a network code on harmonised transmission tariff structures for gas, and set out the Union-wide rules which have the objectives of contributing to market integration, enhancing security of supply and promoting the interconnection between gas networks.</p>

               <p>A crucial step in reaching these objectives is to increase the transparency of transmission tariff structures and procedures towards setting them. Therefore, it is necessary to set out the requirements for publishing the information related to the determination of the revenues of transmission system operators and to the derivation of different transmission and non-transmission tariffs. These requirements should enable network users to understand better the tariffs set for both transmission services and non-transmission services, as well as how such tariffs have changed, are set and may change. Additionally, network users should be able to understand the costs underlying transmission tariffs and to forecast transmission tariffs to a reasonable extent. The transparency requirements set out in this Regulation further harmonise the rule laid down in point 3.1.2(a) of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 715/2009.</p>

               <p>After the introduction of the concept of the entry-exit system by Regulation (EC) No 715/2009, transmission costs are no longer directly associated to one specific route as entry and exit capacity can be contracted separately, and network users can have gas transported from any entry to any exit point. Under this framework, the transmission system operator decides the most efficient way of flowing gas through the system. Hence, in order to achieve and ensure a reasonable level of cost reflectivity and predictability in such a system, transmission tariffs need to be based on a reference price methodology using specific cost drivers. The guiding principles in order to apply a consistent and transparent reference price methodology should be set out. The obligation to consult on the proposed reference price methodology should be laid down. Where the proposed reference price methodology is other than the capacity weighted distance reference price methodology, the latter should serve as a counterfactual for comparison with the proposed reference price methodology.</p>

               <p>In order to avoid double charging for transmission to and from storage facilities, this Regulation should set a minimum discount acknowledging the general contribution to system flexibility and security of supply of such infrastructure. Storage facilities with direct access to the transmission systems of two or more transmission system operators in directly connected entry-exit systems, or simultaneously to a transmission system and a distribution system allow for transporting gas between directly connected systems. Applying a discount at entry points from or exit points to storage facilities in cases where storage facilities are used to transport gas between directly connected systems would benefit these network users compared to other network users booking capacity products without a discount at interconnection points or using storage facilities to transport gas within the same system. This Regulation should introduce mechanisms to avoid such discrimination.</p>

               <p>In order to promote security of supply, the granting of discounts should be considered for entry points from LNG facilities, and at entry points from and exit points to infrastructure developed with the purpose of ending the isolation of Member States in respect of their gas transmission systems.</p>

               <p>Transmission system operators in certain entry-exit systems transport significantly more gas into other systems than for consumption into their own entry-exit system. Consequently, reference price methodologies should include safeguards required to shelter such captive customers from risks related to large transit flows.</p>

                     <p>The minimum price at which transmission system operators shall accept a request for incremental capacity is the reference price. For the calculation of the economic test, reference prices shall be derived by including into the reference price methodology the relevant assumptions related to the offer of incremental capacity.</p>

                     <p>Where the fixed payable price approach set out in Article 24(b) is considered to be offered for incremental capacity, the reserve price referred to in Article 24(b) shall be based on projected investment and operating costs. Once the incremental capacity is commissioned, such reserve price shall be adjusted proportionally to the difference, irrespective whether positive or negative, between the projected investment costs and the actual investment costs.</p>

                     <p>In case the allocation of all incremental capacity at the reference price would not generate sufficient revenues for a positive economic test outcome, a mandatory minimum premium may be applied in the first auction or alternative allocation mechanism in which the incremental capacity is offered. The mandatory minimum premium may also be applied in subsequent auctions when the capacity is offered that initially remained unsold or when capacity is offered that was initially set aside according to Article 8(8) and (9) of Regulation (EU) 2017/459. The decision on whether and in which auctions to apply a mandatory minimum premium shall be taken in accordance with Article 41(6)(a) of Directive 2009/73/EC.</p>

                     <p>The level of the mandatory minimum premium shall enable a positive economic test outcome with the revenues generated by the offered capacity in the first auction or alternative allocation mechanism in which the incremental capacity is on offer. The range of the level for the mandatory minimum premium, depending on the expected allocated capacity, shall be submitted to the relevant national regulatory authorities for approval in accordance with Article 25(1)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2017/459.</p>

                     <p>A mandatory minimum premium approved by the national regulatory authority shall be added to the reference price for the bundled capacity products at the respective interconnection point and shall exclusively be attributed to the transmission system operators for which the mandatory minimum premium was approved by the respective national regulatory authority. This default principle for the attribution of a mandatory minimum premium is without prejudice to the split of a possible additional auction premium according to Article 21(3) or an alternative agreement between the involved national regulatory authorities.</p>
