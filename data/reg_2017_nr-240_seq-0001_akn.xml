As supervised entities apply different accounting standards, only information related to valuation rules, including methods for estimation of credit risk losses, which exist under the relevant accounting standards and are applied by the corresponding supervised entities on an individual or consolidated basis shall be submitted. For these purposes, specific reporting templates are provided for supervised entities applying national accounting frameworks based on Directive 86/635/EEC. Data points within the templates which are not applicable to the respective supervised entities do not have to be reported.</p>
