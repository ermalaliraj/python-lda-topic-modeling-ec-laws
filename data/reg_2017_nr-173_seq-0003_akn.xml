               <p>Following an application from Granarolo S.p.A., submitted pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to a low-fat fermented milk with a combination of fructooligosaccharides and live <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> GG (ATCC 53103), <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i> (Z57) and <i>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</i> subsp. <i>bulgaricus</i> (LB2), and defence against reactivation of Herpes simplex virus in the orolabial epithelia (Question No EFSA-Q-2015-00488<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">

The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: &apos;Consumption of low-fat fermented milk with a combination of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and live <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> GG (ATCC 53103), <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i> (Z57) and <i>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</i> subsp. <i>bulgaricus</i> (LB2) helps to reduce recurrence of lip cold sores caused by Herpes simplex virus infection in healthy susceptible individuals&apos;.</p>

               <p>On 19 July 2016, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority, which concluded that, on the basis of the data presented, a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of the low-fat fermented milk, which was the subject of the health claim, and defence against reactivation of Herpes simplex virus in the orolabial epithelia. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.</p>

               <p>On 22 July 2016, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority, which noted that the evidence provided by the applicant does not establish that a reduction in post-prandial glycaemic responses achieved by an increase in insulin secretion is a beneficial physiological effect for the target population of the claim. Therefore, on the basis of the data presented, the Authority concluded that a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of the food subject to the claim and a beneficial physiological effect for the target population. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.</p>
