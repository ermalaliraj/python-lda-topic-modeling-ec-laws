Unless a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by the date following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom, or the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, unanimously decides to extend the period provided for in Article 50(3) TEU for a third time, the period provided for in Article 50(3) TEU will end on 31 October 2019.</p>

               <p>The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without a withdrawal agreement is likely to negatively affect some industries and services by leading to people working in those sectors being made redundant. This Regulation should amend Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 in order to specify that such redundancies fall within the scope of the EGF. This would ensure that the EGF can respond effectively by offering assistance to workers made redundant in areas, sectors, territories or labour markets subject to serious economic disruption due to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without a withdrawal agreement.</p>
