Therefore, in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 86(1) TFEU, the authorisation to proceed with enhanced cooperation referred to in Article 20(2) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Article 329(1) TFEU is deemed to be granted and the provisions on enhanced cooperation apply as from 3 April 2017. In addition, respectively by letters of 19 April 2017, 1 June 2017, 9 June 2017 and 22 June 2017, Latvia, Estonia, Austria and Italy indicated their wish to participate in the establishment of the enhanced cooperation.</p>

It is also to be open to them at any other time, including with regard to an enhanced cooperation in progress subject to compliance with the acts already adopted within that framework. The Commission and the Member States which participate in enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the EPPO (the &apos;Member States&apos;) should ensure that they promote participation by as many Member States of the European Union as possible. This Regulation should be binding in its entirety and directly applicable only in the Member States which participate in enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the EPPO, or by virtue of a decision adopted in accordance with the second or third subparagraph of Article 331(1) TFEU.</p>

               <p>The TFEU provides that the material scope of competence of the EPPO is limited to criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union in accordance with this Regulation. The tasks of the EPPO should thus be to investigate, prosecute and bring to judgment the perpetrators of offences against the Union&apos;s financial interests under Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">

               <p>In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, combatting crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union can be better achieved at Union level by reason of its scale and effects. The present situation, in which the criminal prosecution of offences against the Union&apos;s financial interests is exclusively in the hands of the authorities of the Member States of the European Union, does not always sufficiently achieve that objective. Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely, to enhance the fight against offences affecting the financial interests of the Union by setting up the EPPO, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States of the European Union, given the fragmentation of national prosecutions in the area of offences committed against the Union&apos;s financial interests but can rather, by reason of the fact that the EPPO is to have competence to prosecute such offences, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives and ensures that its impact on the legal orders and the institutional structures of the Member States is the least intrusive possible.</p>

As a result, any of these institutions can apply to the Court of Justice of the European Union (the &apos;Court of Justice&apos;), with a view to his/her removal under certain circumstances, including in cases of serious misconduct.

This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6 TEU and in the Charter, in particular Title VI thereof, by international law and by international agreements to which the Union or all the Member States are party, including the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and by Member States&apos; constitutions in their respective fields of application.

               <p>National legal systems provide for various types of simplified prosecution procedures, which may or may not include involvement of a court, for example in the form of transactions with the suspect or accused person. If such procedures exist, the European Delegated Prosecutor should have the power to apply them under the conditions provided for in national law and in the situations provided for by this Regulation. Those situations should include cases where the final damage of the offence, after possible recovery of an amount corresponding to such damage, is not significant. Considering the interest of a coherent and effective prosecution policy of the EPPO, the competent Permanent Chamber should always be called upon to give its consent to the use of such procedures. When the simplified procedure has been successfully applied, the case should be finally disposed of.</p>

               <p>Article 86(3) TFEU allows the Union legislator to determine the rules applicable to the judicial review of procedural measures taken by the EPPO in the performance of its functions. That competence granted to the Union legislator reflects the specific nature of the tasks and structure of the EPPO, which is different from that of all other bodies and agencies of the Union and requires special rules regarding judicial review.</p>

               <p>According to Article 86(2) TFEU, the EPPO exercises its functions of prosecutor before the competent courts of the Member States. Acts undertaken by the EPPO in the course of its investigations are closely related to the prosecution which may result therefrom, and thus have effects in the legal order of the Member States. In many cases the acts will be carried out by national law enforcement authorities acting under the instructions of the EPPO, in some cases after having obtained the authorisation of a national court. It is therefore appropriate to consider that procedural acts of the EPPO that are intended to produce legal effects vis-à-vis third parties should be subject to review by the competent national courts in accordance with the requirements and procedures laid down by national law. This should ensure that the procedural acts of the EPPO that are adopted before the indictment and intended to produce legal effects vis-à-vis third parties (a category which includes the suspect, the victim, and other interested persons whose rights may be adversely affected by such acts) are subject to judicial review by national courts. Procedural acts that relate to the choice of the Member State whose courts will be competent to hear the prosecution, which is to be determined on the basis of the criteria laid down in this Regulation, are intended to produce legal effects vis-à-vis third parties and should therefore be subject to judicial review by national courts, at the latest at the trial stage. Actions before competent national courts for failures of the EPPO to act are those regarding procedural acts which the EPPO is under a legal obligation to adopt and which are intended to produce legal effects vis-à-vis third parties. Where national law provides for judicial review concerning procedural acts which are not intended to produce legal effects vis-à-vis third parties or for legal actions concerning other failures to act, this Regulation should not be interpreted as affecting such legal provisions. In addition, Member States should not be required to provide for judicial review by the competent national courts of procedural acts which are not intended to produce legal effects vis-à-vis third parties, such as the appointment of experts or the reimbursement of witness costs. Finally, this Regulation does not affect the powers of national trial courts.</p>

               <p>The legality of procedural acts of the EPPO that are intended to produce legal effects vis-à-vis third parties should be subject to judicial review before national courts. In that regard, effective remedies should be ensured in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 19(1) TEU. Furthermore, as underlined by the case-law of the Court of Justice, the national procedural rules governing actions for the protection of individual rights granted by Union law must be no less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (principle of equivalence) and must not render practically impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Union law (principle of effectiveness). When national courts review the legality of such acts, they may do so on the basis of Union law, including this Regulation, and also on the basis of national law, which applies to the extent that a matter is not dealt with by this Regulation. As underlined in the case-law of the Court of Justice, national courts should always refer preliminary questions to the Court of Justice when they entertain doubts about the validity of those acts vis-à-vis Union law. However, national courts may not refer to the Court of Justice preliminary questions on the validity of the procedural acts of the EPPO with regard to national procedural law or to national measures transposing Directives, even if this Regulation refers to them. This is however without prejudice to preliminary references concerning the interpretation of any provision of primary law, including the Treaties and the Charter, or the interpretation and validity of any provision of Union secondary law, including this Regulation and applicable Directives. In addition, this Regulation does not exclude the possibility for national courts to review the validity of the procedural acts of the EPPO which are intended to produce legal effects vis-à-vis third parties with regard to the principle of proportionality as enshrined in national law.</p>

For the purpose of this Regulation, &apos;international organisations&apos; means international organisations and their subordinate bodies governed by public international law or other bodies which are set up by, or on the basis of, an agreement between two or more countries as well as Interpol.</p>

               <p>Where the College identifies an operational need for cooperation with a third country or an international organisation, it should be able to suggest that the Council draw the attention of the Commission to the need for an adequacy decision or for a recommendation on the opening of negotiations on an international agreement. Pending the conclusion of new international agreements by the Union or the accession by the Union to multilateral agreements already concluded by the Member States, on legal assistance in criminal matters, the Member States should facilitate the exercise by the EPPO of its functions pursuant to the principle of sincere cooperation enshrined in Article 4(3) TEU. If permitted under a relevant multilateral agreement and subject to the third country&apos;s acceptance, the Member States should recognise and, where applicable, notify the EPPO as a competent authority for the purpose of the implementation of those multilateral agreements. This may entail, in certain cases, an amendment to those agreements but the renegotiation of such agreements should not be regarded as a mandatory step, since it may not always be possible. The Member States may also notify the EPPO as a competent authority for the purpose of the implementation of other international agreements on legal assistance in criminal matters concluded by them, including by way of an amendment to those agreements. Where the notification of the EPPO as a competent authority for the purposes of multilateral agreements already concluded by the Member States with third countries is not possible or is not accepted by the third countries and pending the Union accession to such international agreements, European Delegated Prosecutors may use their status as national prosecutor toward such third countries, provided that they inform and where appropriate endeavour to obtain consent from the authorities of third countries that the evidence collected from these third countries on the basis of those international agreements, will be used in investigations and prosecutions carried out by the EPPO. The EPPO should also be able to rely on reciprocity or international comity vis à-vis the authorities of third countries. This should however be carried out on a case-by-case basis, within the limits of the material competence of the EPPO and subject to possible conditions set by the authorities of the third countries.</p>

               <p>Member States of the European Union which do not participate in enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the EPPO are not bound by this Regulation. The Commission should, if appropriate, submit proposals in order to ensure effective judicial cooperation in criminal matters between the EPPO and Member States of the European Union which do not participate in enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the EPPO. This should in particular concern the rules relating to judicial cooperation in criminal matters and surrender, fully respecting the Union <i>acquis</i> in this field as well as the duty of sincere cooperation in accordance with Article 4(3) TEU.</p>

Exceptionally high costs for investigation measures such as complex experts&apos; opinions, extensive police operations or surveillance activities over a long period of time could partly be reimbursed by the EPPO, including, where possible, by reallocating resources from other budget lines of the EPPO, or by amending the budget in accordance with this Regulation and the applicable financial rules.

These should include the cost of operational communication between the European Delegated Prosecutor and the central level of the EPPO, such as mail delivery costs, travel expenses, translations necessary for the internal functioning of the EPPO, and other costs not previously incurred by Member States during an investigation which are caused only due to the EPPO having assumed responsibilities for investigation and prosecution. However, the costs of the European Delegated Prosecutors&apos; office and secretarial support should be covered by the Member States. In accordance with Article 332 TFEU, expenditure resulting from the implementation of the EPPO will be borne by the Member States.
