                     <p>Council Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 of 17 December 2013 suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural and industrial products and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011 (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 201).</p>

               <p>It is necessary to modify the conditions for 38 suspensions of autonomous CCT duties, listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013, in order to take into account technical product developments and economic trends on the market. In relation to some measures in force, the classification was adapted in order to allow industry to fully benefit from the suspensions in force. Moreover, the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 was updated in order to take into account the need to align or clarify texts in some cases. The modified conditions relate to changes in the product description, classification, duty rates or end-use requirements. Moreover, in the light of the agreement in the form of the Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2">
                     <p>OJ L 161, 18.6.2016, p. 4.</p>

                  </authorialNote>, 441 items should be amended. The suspensions in respect of which modifications are necessary should be deleted from the list of suspensions in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013, and the modified suspensions should be inserted into that list.</p>

               <p>It is also necessary, in the interest of the Union, to amend the end date for the mandatory review of 206 products listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 in order to allow duty-free imports beyond that date. The autonomous CCT duty suspensions for those products have been reviewed and new revised dates should be set for their next mandatory review.</p>

               <p>It is no longer in the interest of the Union to maintain the suspension of autonomous CCT duties for 18 of the products that are listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013. Moreover, according to the Communication from the Commission concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4">
                     <p>OJ C 363, 13.12.2011, p. 6.</p>
                  </authorialNote> (&apos;the Commission Communication&apos;), for administrative and financial reasons, requests where the amount of uncollected customs duty is estimated to be less than EUR 15000 per year cannot be taken into consideration. The mandatory review of the existing suspensions has indicated that imports in relation to 71 suspensions do not reach that threshold. Those suspensions should therefore be deleted from that Annex. In addition, 27 suspensions should be deleted from that Annex as a result of the agreement in the form of the Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products, which reduced the duty rate for the products concerned to zero.</p>
