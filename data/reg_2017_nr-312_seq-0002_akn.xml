               <p>A well-functioning internal market in electricity should provide producers with appropriate incentives for investing in new power generation, including in electricity from renewable energy sources, paying special attention to the most isolated Member States and regions in the Union&apos;s energy market.

               <p>Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 sets out non-discriminatory rules on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity and, in particular, rules on capacity allocation for interconnections and transmission systems affecting cross-border electricity flows. In order to move towards a genuinely integrated electricity market and to ensure operational security, efficient balancing rules should be developed in order to provide incentives for market participants to contribute to solving the system scarcities for which they are responsible. In particular, it is necessary to set up rules related to the technical and operational aspects of system balancing and to energy trading. Such rules should include system-related power reserve rules.</p>

                  </authorialNote> sets out harmonised rules on system operation applicable to transmission system operators (&apos;TSOs&apos;), regional security coordinators, distribution system operators (&apos;DSOs&apos;) and significant grid users. It identifies different critical system states (normal state, alert state, emergency state, blackout state and restoration state). It also sets out requirements and principles to maintain operational security throughout the Union and aims to promote the coordination of requirements and principles for Union-wide load-frequency-control and reserves.</p>

               <p>This Regulation establishes an EU-wide set of technical, operational and market rules to govern the functioning of electricity balancing markets. It sets out rules for the procurement of balancing capacity, the activation of balancing energy and the financial settlement of balance responsible parties. It also requires the development of harmonised methodologies for the allocation of cross-zonal transmission capacity for balancing purposes. Such rules will increase the liquidity of short-term markets by allowing for more cross-border trade and for a more efficient use of the existing grid for the purposes of balancing energy. As balancing energy bids will compete on EU-wide balancing platforms, it will also have positive effects on competition.</p>

               <p>This Regulation pursues the objective of ensuring the optimal management and coordinated operation of the European electricity transmission system, while supporting the achievement of the Union&apos;s targets for penetration of renewable generation, as well as providing benefits for customers. TSOs, working with DSOs where relevant, should be responsible for organising European balancing markets and should strive for their integration, keeping the system in balance in the most efficient manner. To do so, TSOs should work in close cooperation with one another and with DSOs, coordinating their activities as much as possible to deliver an efficient electricity system, across all regions and voltage levels, without prejudice to competition law.</p>

The delegating TSO should remain responsible for ensuring compliance with the obligations in this Regulation. Likewise Member States should be able to assign tasks and obligations under this Regulation to a third party. Such assignment should be limited to tasks and obligations executed at national level (such as imbalance settlement). The limitations to the assignment should not lead to unnecessary changes to the existing national arrangements.

               <p>In order to enable TSOs to procure and use balancing capacity in an efficient, economic and market-based manner, there is a need to foster market integration. In this regard, this Regulation establishes three methodologies through which TSOs may allocate cross-zonal capacity for the exchange of balancing capacity and sharing of reserves, when supported on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis: the co-optimisation process, the market-based allocation process and the allocation based on an economic efficiency analysis. The co-optimisationallocation process should be performed on a day-ahead basis whereas the market-based allocation process could be performed where the contracting is done not more than one week in advance of the provision of the balancing capacity and the allocation based on an economic efficiency analysis where the contracting is done more than one week in advance of the provision of the balancing capacity on the conditions that the volumes allocated are limited and that an assessment is done every year.</p>

The application of such a methodology, where existing, should nevertheless be harmonised by all TSOs in order to foster market integration.</p>

               <p>The general objective of imbalance settlement is to ensure that balance responsible parties support the system&apos;s balance in an efficient way and to incentivise market participants in keeping and/or helping to restore the system balance. This Regulation defines rules on imbalance settlement, ensuring that it is made in a non-discriminatory, fair, objective and transparent basis. To make balancing markets and the overall energy system fit for the integration of increasing shares of variable renewables, imbalance prices should reflect the real-time value of energy.</p>
