               <p>The development, production and dissemination of statistical information on the economic activities of Member States&apos; businesses has so far been based on a number of individual legal acts. Those legal acts cover short-term and structural business statistics, statistics on production, intra-Union and extra-Union trade (international trade) in goods and services, foreign affiliates, research and development (R&amp;D), innovation and information and communication technologies (ICT) usage and e‚Äêcommerce. Moreover, a common framework for business registers for statistical purposes in the Union was established by Regulation (EC) No 177/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">

               <p>This structure based on individual legal acts does not provide the necessary consistency across the individual statistical domains, nor does it promote an integrated approach towards the development, production and dissemination of business statistics. For the purpose of this Regulation, European business statistics should also cover R&amp;D statistics in the higher education, government and private non-profit sectors. A common legal framework should be established to ensure consistency across European business statistics and facilitate the integration of the corresponding statistical processes.</p>

Such guidance should, to the extent possible, be followed in the development, production and dissemination of Union statistics and within the European framework for statistical business registers, in order to ensure that the Union statistics are comparable with those compiled by the Union&apos;s main international partners.

               <p>Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 constitutes the reference framework for this Regulation, including as regards the protection of confidential data. However, the very detailed level of information in the field of statistics on international trade in goods requires specific rules with regard to confidentiality. An importer or exporter of goods needs to submit a request to the NSA that statistical results allowing the indirect identification of such an importer or exporter are not disclosed. The NSA should consider the request to be justified where the statistical results allow the indirect identification of the importer or exporter. Otherwise, the NSA should be able to disseminate the statistical results in a form that make it possible for the importer or exporter to be identified indirectly.</p>

               <p>In order to take account of economic and technical developments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in order to amend the types of statistical information, to further specify the details of the statistical information to be provided by the tax and customs authorities in accordance with Annexes V and VI, respectively, and to amend the detailed topics set out in Annex I and this Regulation by reducing the coverage rate for intra-Union exports of goods. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="10">
