                     <p>Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 establishing a single European railway area (OJ L 343, 14.12.2012, p. 32).</p>

               <p>Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 is inconsistent and incompatible with legislative measures currently in force. In particular, in the context of a liberalised market, where railway undertakings compete directly with the enumerated railway undertakings, it is no longer appropriate to treat those two groups differently from one another.</p>

               <p>Member States may pay compensation for the costs of crossing facilities on the basis of Article 8 of Directive 2012/34/EU. They may, nevertheless, need time to amend their national law and administrative provisions to take account of the repeal of Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69. As a consequence, this repeal should not take immediate effect for cases covered by Annex IV to Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69,</p>
