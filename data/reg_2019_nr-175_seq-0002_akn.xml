                     <p>Council Regulation (EC) No 2166/2005 of 20 December 2005 establishing measures for the recovery of the Southern hake and Norway lobster stocks in the Cantabrian Sea and Western Iberian peninsula and amending Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (OJ L 345, 28.12.2005, p. 5).</p>
                  </authorialNote>. The fishing effort limits in Annex IIA of Council Regulation (EU) 2019/124 were set in accordance with that recovery plan. As the stocks concerned will be managed in line with the provisions of the multiannual plan for the Western Waters by setting catch limits to achieve target fishing mortality in line with the ranges of the maximum sustainable yield (F<sub>MSY</sub>), it is no longer necessary to continue setting fishing effort limits for the fleets fishing for those stocks. Annex IIA of Council Regulation (EU) 2019/124 should therefore be repealed.</p>

               <p>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) issued scientific advice for no catches for whiting (<i>Merlangius merlangus</i>) in the ICES division 7a (the Irish Sea). The by-catch total allowable catch (TAC) for that stock for 2019 has been set to strike the right balance between continuing fisheries, in view of the potentially severe socio-economic implications, and the need to achieve a good biological status for those stocks, taking into account the difficulty of fishing all stocks in a mixed fishery at F<sub>MSY</sub> at the same time. The updated scientific analysis from the ICES on the status of whiting in ICES division 7a and its unavoidable by-catches in other fisheries provided for the status quo scenario estimating corresponding catches at 1385 tonnes. Following this scientific analysis, the TAC should be amended to reflect an amount that will minimise the risk of an early fisheries closure, whilst allowing the spawning stock biomass to continue recovering. The level of the TAC should also reflect that the mortality for that stock is not increased and that the TAC provides incentives for improvements in selectivity and avoidance.</p>

               <p>In December 2018, the Member States concerned agreed that they would cooperate in the North Western Waters Member States Group and in close cooperation with the North Western Waters Advisory Council to prepare a multiannual by-catch reduction plan. This plan should ensure that by-catches of the five stocks in question, including whiting in the Irish Sea, for which the ICES has issued zero catch advice for 2019, are reduced through selectivity or avoidance measures. The Commission has indicated that it intends to submit this plan for the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) Plenary Session in July 2019, in order to assess its effectiveness. If the STECF assessment shows that the by-catch reduction plan will not achieve the desired effect of reducing fishing mortality on by-catches, the Commission has indicated that it will consider alternative measures to reduce the fishing mortality for the stocks concerned.</p>

The TAC for sprat in 3a was set at 26624 tonnes. The fishing opportunities for sprat in the Union waters of ICES division 2a and subarea 4 should be set taking into account the TAC already fixed for ICES division 3a and in line with the F<sub>MSY</sub>.

ICES will issue its advice for this stock only at the end of June 2019, although the fishery continues during the summer period.

The TAC would be amended in the future, in line with the ICES scientific advice.</p>

               <p>At its 21st special meeting in 2018, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) adopted Recommendation 18-02 establishing a multiannual management plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. That management plan follows the advice from the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics to establish a multiannual management plan for the stock in 2018, since the current status of the stock no longer requires the emergency measures introduced under the recovery plan for bluefin tuna (Recommendation 17-17 amending Recommendation 14-04). The management plan takes into account the specificities of the different types of gear and fishing techniques. Therefore, it is appropriate to revise the provisions on effort limits and maximum input in tuna farms.</p>
