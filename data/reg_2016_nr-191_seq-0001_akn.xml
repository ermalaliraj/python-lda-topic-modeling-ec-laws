               <p>It is appropriate to establish the target fishing mortality (F) that corresponds to the objective of reaching and maintaining MSY as ranges of values which are consistent with achieving maximum sustainable yield (F<sub>MSY</sub>). Those ranges, based on scientific advice, are necessary in order to provide flexibility to take account of developments in the scientific advice, to contribute to the implementation of the landing obligation and to take into account the characteristics of mixed fisheries. The F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges have been calculated by ICES on the basis of a number of considerations. The ranges are derived to deliver no more than a 5 % reduction in long-term yield compared to MSY. The upper limit of the range is capped, so that the probability of the stock falling below the limit spawning stock biomass reference point (B<sub>lim</sub>) is no more than 5 %. That upper limit also conforms to the so-called ICES advice rule, which indicates that when the spawning stock biomass is below the minimum spawning stock biomass reference point (MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>), F is to be reduced to a value that does not exceed an upper limit equal to the F<sub>MSY</sub> point value multiplied by the spawning stock biomass in the TAC year, divided by MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. ICES uses those considerations and the advice rule in its provision of scientific advice on fishing mortality and catch options.</p>

               <p>For the purposes of fixing fishing opportunities, there should be an upper threshold for F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges in normal use and, provided that the stock concerned is considered to be in a good state (above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>), an upper limit for certain cases. It should only be possible to fix fishing opportunities to the upper limit if, on the basis of scientific advice or evidence, it is necessary for the achievement of the objectives laid down in this Regulation in mixed fisheries or necessary to avoid harm to a stock caused by intra- or inter-species stock dynamics, or in order to limit the year-to-year variations in fishing opportunities. For the purpose of applying the upper limit, it is necessary to recall the objectives set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 that the MSY exploitation rate is to be achieved in any event by 2020.</p>

                     <p>Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound, amending Regulation (EC) No 1434/98 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 88/98 (OJ L 349, 31.12.2005, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote> should be amended. It is necessary to maintain the area restrictions on fishing established by Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 in order to protect spawning and juvenile fish. It is also necessary to clarify the relationship between the plan and Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 as regards technical measures and to establish appropriate procedures for the adoption of technical measures in the context of multiannual plans. In addition, the specific rules on gear kept on board by vessels targeting cod should be deleted.</p>
