               <p>The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the &apos;Charter&apos;) became legally binding with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009. The definition of torture in Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 was taken over from the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and continues to be valid. The definition of &apos;other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&apos;, which is not found in that Convention, should be amended to align it with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. It is also appropriate to clarify the meaning of the term &apos;lawful penalties&apos; in the definitions of &apos;torture&apos; and &apos;other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&apos;, taking into account the Union&apos;s policy on capital punishment.</p>

               <p>Given the differences between capital punishment, on the one hand, and torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment on the other, it is appropriate to establish a specific export authorisation system with a view to preventing the use of certain goods for capital punishment. Such a system should take into account the fact that a number of countries have abolished capital punishment for all crimes and have made an international commitment on this issue. As there is a risk of re-export to countries that have not done so, certain conditions and requirements should be imposed when authorising exports to countries that have abolished capital punishment. It is therefore appropriate to grant a general export authorisation for exports to those countries that have abolished capital punishment for all crimes and confirmed that abolition through an international commitment.</p>

               <p>If a country has not abolished capital punishment for all crimes and confirmed that abolition through an international commitment, the competent authorities should, when examining a request for an export authorisation, check whether there is a risk that the end-user in the country of destination would use the exported goods for such punishment. Appropriate conditions and requirements should be imposed to control sales or transfers to third parties by the end-user. If multiple shipments between the same exporter and end-user take place, the competent authorities should be allowed to review the status of the end-user on a periodic basis, for example every six months, rather than every time an export authorisation for a shipment is granted, without prejudice to the right of the competent authorities to annul, suspend, modify or revoke an export authorisation in accordance with Article 9(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 where warranted.</p>

               <p>In order to limit the administrative burden for exporters, the competent authorities should be allowed to grant an exporter a global authorisation for all shipments of medicinal products from the exporter to a specific end-user for a fixed period of time, specifying, where necessary, a quantity corresponding to the end-user&apos;s normal use of such products. Such authorisation would, in accordance with Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 be valid for between one and three years with a possible extension of up to two years.</p>

               <p>Granting a global authorisation would also be appropriate where a manufacturer intends to export medicinal products falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 to a distributor in a country that has not abolished capital punishment, provided the exporter and the distributor have concluded a legally binding agreement requiring the distributor to apply an appropriate set of measures ensuring that the medicinal products will not be used for capital punishment.</p>

It should not include non-lethal goods which are not essential for executing a convicted person, such as standard furniture that may also be found in the execution chamber.</p>

               <p>Medicinal products falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 may be subject to controls in accordance with international conventions on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, such as the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Since such controls are not applied to prevent the relevant medicinal products from being used for capital punishment but to prevent illicit drug trafficking, the export controls of Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 should be applied in addition to the international controls. Member States should, however, be encouraged to use a single procedure in order to apply both control systems.</p>

The group should serve as a platform for Member States&apos; experts and the Commission to exchange information on administrative practices and to discuss questions of interpretation of this Regulation, technical issues with respect to the goods listed, developments related to this Regulation and any other questions that may arise. The group may, in particular, discuss issues related to the nature and the intended effect of goods, the availability of goods in third countries and the question whether goods are specifically designed or modified for capital punishment or for torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. If the Commission decides to consult the group when preparing delegated acts, it should do so in accordance with the principles laid down in the Inter-institutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making.</p>

               <p>The Commission does not procure equipment for law enforcement purposes since it is not responsible for maintenance of law and order, proceedings in criminal matters or the enforcement of judicial decisions in criminal matters. Therefore, a procedure should be established to ensure that the Commission receives information on non-listed law enforcement equipment and products marketed in the Union in order to ensure that the lists of goods whose trade is prohibited or controlled are updated to take account of new developments. When addressing its request to the Commission, the requesting Member State should forward its request to add goods to Annex II, to Annex III or to Annex IIIa to Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 to other Member States.</p>
