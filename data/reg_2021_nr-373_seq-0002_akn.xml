               <p>For aminopyralid, maximum residue levels (MRLs) were set in Part A of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. For 6-benzyladenine, no MRLs were set in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, and as that active substance is not included in Annex IV to that Regulation, the default value of 0,01 mg/kg laid down in Article 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 applies.</p>

               <p>The Commission consulted the European Union reference laboratories for residues of pesticides as regards the need to adapt certain LODs.
