               <p>The Commission has, in its communication of 11 December 2019 entitled &apos;The European Green Deal&apos; (the &apos;European Green Deal&apos;), set out a new growth strategy that aims to transform the Union into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy, where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use. The European Green Deal also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union&apos;s natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. At the same time, this transition must be just and inclusive, leaving no one behind.</p>

               <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides in its 2018 Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty, a strong scientific basis for tackling climate change and illustrates the need to rapidly step up climate action and to continue the transition to a climate-neutral economy. That report confirms that greenhouse gas emissions need to be urgently reduced, and that climate change needs to be limited to 1,5 °C, in particular to reduce the likelihood of extreme weather events and of reaching tipping points. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has shown in its 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services a worldwide erosion of biodiversity, with climate change as the third most important driver of biodiversity loss.</p>

               <p>Climate action should be an opportunity for all sectors of the economy in the Union to help secure industry leadership in global innovation. Driven by the Union&apos;s regulatory framework and efforts made by industry, it is possible to decouple economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. For example, Union greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 24 % between 1990 and 2019, while the economy grew by 60 % over the same period. Without prejudice to binding legislation and other initiatives adopted at Union level, all sectors of the economy &#45; including energy, industry, transport, heating and cooling and buildings, agriculture, waste and land use, land-use change and forestry, irrespective of whether those sectors are covered by the system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union (&apos;EU ETS&apos;) &#45; should play a role in contributing to the achievement of climate neutrality within the Union by 2050. In order to enhance involvement of all economic actors, the Commission should facilitate sector-specific climate dialogues and partnerships by bringing together key stakeholders in an inclusive and representative manner, so as to encourage sectors themselves to draw up indicative voluntary roadmaps and to plan their transition towards achieving the Union&apos;s climate-neutrality objective by 2050. Such roadmaps could make a valuable contribution in assisting sectors in planning the necessary investments towards the transition to a climate-neutral economy and could also serve to strengthen sectoral engagement in the pursuit of climate-neutral solutions. Such roadmaps could also complement existing initiatives, including the European Battery Alliance and the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, which foster industrial collaboration in the transition to climate neutrality.</p>

It has also repeatedly called on the Union to increase its 2030 climate target, and for that increased target to be part of this Regulation. The European Council, in its conclusions of 12 December 2019, has agreed on the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, while also recognising that it is necessary to put in place an enabling framework that benefits all Member States and encompasses adequate instruments, incentives, support and investments to ensure a cost-efficient, just, as well as socially balanced and fair transition, taking into account different national circumstances in terms of starting points. It also noted that the transition will require significant public and private investment. On 6 March 2020, the Union submitted its long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy and, on 17 December 2020, its nationally determined contribution, to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), following their approval by the Council.</p>

               <p>The Union should aim to achieve a balance between anthropogenic economy-wide emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases domestically within the Union by 2050 and, as appropriate, achieve negative emissions thereafter. That objective should encompass Union-wide greenhouse gas emissions and removals regulated in Union law. It should be possible to address such emissions and removals in the context of the review of the relevant climate and energy legislation. Sinks include natural and technological solutions, as reported in the Union&apos;s greenhouse gas inventories to the UNFCCC. Solutions that are based on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and use (CCU) technologies can play a role in decarbonisation, especially for the mitigation of process emissions in industry, for the Member States that choose this technology. The Union-wide 2050 climate-neutrality objective should be pursued by all Member States collectively, and Member States, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should take the necessary measures to enable its achievement. Measures at Union level will constitute an important part of the measures needed to achieve the objective.</p>

Its mission should avoid any overlap with the mission of the IPCC at international level.

               <p>The transition to climate neutrality requires changes across the entire policy spectrum and a collective effort of all sectors of the economy and society, as highlighted in the European Green Deal. The European Council, in its conclusions of 12 December 2019, stated that all relevant Union legislation and policies need to be consistent with, and contribute to, the fulfilment of the climate-neutrality objective while respecting a level playing field, and invited the Commission to examine whether this requires an adjustment of the existing rules.</p>

               <p>As announced in the European Green Deal, the Commission assessed the Union&apos;s 2030 target for greenhouse gas emission reduction, in its communication of 17 September 2020 entitled &apos;Stepping up Europe&apos;s 2030 climate ambition &#45; Investing in a climate-neutral future for the benefit of our people&apos;. The Commission did so on the basis of a comprehensive impact assessment and taking into account its analysis of the integrated national energy and climate plans submitted to it in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="12">
                     <p>Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote>. In light of the 2050 climate-neutrality objective, by 2030 greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced and removals enhanced, so that net greenhouse gas emissions, that is emissions after the deduction of removals, are reduced economy-wide and domestically by at least 55 % by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The European Council endorsed that target in its conclusions of 10 and 11 December 2020. It also provided initial guidance on its implementation. That new Union 2030 climate target is a subsequent target for the purposes of point (11) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and therefore replaces the 2030 Union-wide target for greenhouse gas emissions set out in that point. In addition, the Commission should, by 30 June 2021, assess how the relevant Union legislation implementing the Union 2030 climate target would need to be amended in order to achieve such net emission reductions. In view of this, the Commission has announced a revision of the relevant climate and energy legislation which will be adopted in a package covering, inter alia, renewables, energy efficiency, land use, energy taxation, CO<sub>2</sub> emission performance standards for light-duty vehicles, effort sharing and the EU ETS. The Commission intends to assess the impacts of the introduction of additional Union measures that could complement existing measures, such as market-based measures that include a strong solidarity mechanism.</p>

               <p>According to Commission assessments, the existing commitments under Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 result in a net carbon sink of 225 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent in 2030. In order to ensure that sufficient mitigation efforts are deployed until 2030, it is appropriate to limit the contribution of net removals to the Union 2030 climate target to that level. This is without prejudice to the review of the relevant Union legislation in order to enable the achievement of the target.</p>

               <p>In order to provide predictability and confidence for all economic actors, including businesses, workers, investors and consumers, to ensure a gradual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over time and that the transition towards climate neutrality is irreversible, the Commission should propose a Union intermediate climate target for 2040, as appropriate, at the latest within six months of the first global stocktake carried out under the Paris Agreement. The Commission can make proposals to revise the intermediate target, taking into account the findings of the assessments of Union progress and measures and of national measures as well as the outcomes of the global stocktake and of international developments, including on common time frames for nationally determined contributions. As a tool to increase the transparency and accountability of the Union&apos;s climate policies, the Commission should, when making its legislative proposal for the Union 2040 climate target, publish the projected indicative Union greenhouse gas budget for the 2030-2050 period, defined as the indicative total volume of net greenhouse gas emissions that are expected to be emitted in that period without putting at risk the Union&apos;s commitments under the Paris Agreement, as well as the methodology underlying that indicative budget.</p>

               <p>Adaptation is a key component of the long-term global response to climate change. The adverse effects of climate change can potentially exceed the adaptive capacities of Member States. Therefore, Member States and the Union should enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, as provided for in Article 7 of the Paris Agreement, as well as maximise the co-benefits with other policies and legislation. The Commission should adopt a Union strategy on adaptation to climate change in line with the Paris Agreement. Member States should adopt comprehensive national adaptation strategies and plans based on robust climate change and vulnerability analyses, progress assessments and indicators, and guided by the best available and most recent scientific evidence. The Union should seek to create a favourable regulatory environment for national policies and measures put in place by Member States to adapt to climate change. Improving climate resilience and adaptive capacities to climate change requires shared efforts by all sectors of the economy and society, as well as policy coherence and consistency in all relevant legislation and policies.</p>

               <p>Ecosystems, people and economies in all regions of the Union will face major impacts from climate change, such as extreme heat, floods, droughts, water scarcity, sea level rise, thawing glaciers, forest fires, windthrows and agricultural losses. Recent extreme events have already had substantial impacts on ecosystems, affecting carbon sequestration and storage capacities of forest and agricultural land. Enhancing adaptive capacities and resilience, taking into account the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, help to minimise climate change impacts, to address unavoidable impacts in a socially balanced manner and to improve living conditions in impacted areas. Preparing early for such impacts is cost-effective and can also bring considerable co-benefits for ecosystems, health and the economy. Nature-based solutions, in particular, can benefit climate change mitigation, adaptation and biodiversity protection.</p>

               <p>To ensure that the Union and the Member States remain on track to achieve the climate-neutrality objective and progress on adaptation, the Commission should regularly assess progress, building upon information as set out in this Regulation, including information submitted and reported under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. In order to allow for a timely preparation for the global stocktake referred to in Article 14 of the Paris Agreement, the conclusions of this assessment should be published by 30 September every five years, starting in 2023. This implies that the reports under Article 29(5) and Article 35 of that Regulation and, in the applicable years, the related reports under Article 29(1) and Article 32 of that Regulation should be submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council at the same time as the conclusions of that assessment. In the event that the collective progress made by Member States towards the achievement of the climate-neutrality objective or on adaptation is insufficient or that Union measures are inconsistent with the climate-neutrality objective or inadequate to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience or reduce vulnerability, the Commission should take the necessary measures in accordance with the Treaties. The Commission should also regularly assess relevant national measures, and issue recommendations where it finds that a Member State&apos;s measures are inconsistent with the climate-neutrality objective or inadequate to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change.</p>
