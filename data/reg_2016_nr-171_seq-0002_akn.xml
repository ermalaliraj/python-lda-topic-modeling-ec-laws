               <p>The breeding of animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species occupies, in economic and social terms, a strategic place in Union agriculture and contributes to the Union&apos;s cultural heritage. This agricultural activity, which contributes to food security in the Union, is a source of income for the agricultural community. The breeding of animals of those species is best promoted by encouraging the use of purebred breeding animals or hybrid breeding pigs of recorded high genetic quality.</p>

To ensure the uniform application of Union rules on breeding animals and to avoid obstacles to trade in breeding animals and their germinal products resulting from divergences in the national transposition of those Directives, the zootechnical and genealogical conditions for trade in breeding animals and their germinal products and their entry into the Union should be laid down in a Regulation.</p>

In the interests of clarity and consistency of Union law, it is also appropriate to provide for more definitions, including a definition of &apos;breed&apos;.</p>

               <p>Efforts to achieve competitiveness in the animal breeding sector should not lead to the disappearance of breeds with characteristics that are adapted to specific biophysical contexts. If their population size is too small, local breeds could be at risk of losing genetic diversity. As an important part of the agricultural biodiversity, animal genetic resources provide an essential basis for the sustainable development of the livestock sector and offer opportunities to adapt animals to changing environments, production conditions and market and consumer demands. Union legal acts on the breeding of animals should thus contribute to the preservation of animal genetic resources, to the protection of biodiversity and to the production of typical quality regional products that rely on the specific hereditary characteristics of local breeds of domestic animals. Union legal acts should also promote viable breeding programmes for the improvement of breeds, and particularly in the case of endangered breeds or autochtonous breeds which are not commonly found in the Union, for the preservation of breeds and the preservation of the genetic diversity within and between breeds.</p>

               <p>Through selection and breeding significant progress has been achieved in the development of traits related to the productivity of farmed animals, leading to reduced production costs at farm level. However, this has, in some cases, led to undesirable side effects, raising concerns in society about animal welfare and environment-related issues. The application of genomics and the use of advanced information technologies such as &apos;Precision livestock farming&apos; &#45; which allows large data sets on alternative traits, directly or indirectly related to animal welfare and sustainability issues, to be recorded &#45; hold considerable potential to address concerns in society and achieve the objectives of sustainable animal breeding in terms of improved resource efficiency and the enhanced resilience and robustness of animals. The collection of data on these alternative traits should gain in importance within the framework of breeding programmes and should be given greater prominence in the definition of selection objectives. In this context, genetic resources of endangered breeds should be considered to be a reservoir of genes that can potentially contribute to achieving these animal welfare and sustainability goals.</p>

               <p>The term &apos;breeding animal&apos; or &apos;purebred breeding animal&apos; should not be understood as only covering animals which still possess their reproductive function. Indeed, castrated animals might contribute with their genealogical and zootechnical records to the assessment of the genetic quality of the breeding population and thus to the integrity of the rankings of breeding animals based on those results. Depending on the objectives of the breeding programme, a lack of or loss of data resulting from the explicit exclusion of castrated animals from entry in a breeding book or register would be likely to bias the results of the assessment of the genetic quality of breeding animals that are genetically related to those castrated animals.</p>

               <p>Breeding programmes on purebred breeding animals are carried out with the overall aim of improving, in a sustainable manner, the production and non-production traits of animals of a breed or to preserve a breed. Those breeding programmes should cover a sufficiently large number of purebred breeding animals kept by breeders which, through breeding and selection, promote and develop desirable traits in those animals or guarantee the preservation of the breed, in accordance with the objectives that are commonly accepted by the participating breeders. Likewise, breeding programmes concerning hybrid breeding pigs are carried out with the purpose of developing desirable traits by deliberate crossbreeding between different breeds, lines or crosses of pigs. Breeding animals (purebred or hybrid) participating in a breeding programme are entered in a breeding book or register, including information on their ascendants, and, depending on the breeding objectives set out in the breeding programme, undergo performance testing or any other assessment that results in the recording of data on traits in relation to the objectives of that breeding programme. Where specified in the breeding programme, genetic evaluation is carried out to estimate the breeding value of the animals which may be ranked accordingly. Those breeding values and performance test results, as well as the genealogical information, form the basis for breeding and selection.</p>

               <p>The right to be recognised as a breed society or breeding operation which meets the established criteria should be a fundamental principle of the Union law on the breeding of animals and of the internal market. The protection of the economic activity of an existing recognised breed society should not justify the refusal by the competent authority of the recognition of a further breed society for the same breed or violations of the principles governing the internal market. The same applies to the approval of a further breeding programme, or to the approval of the geographical extension of an existing breeding programme, which is carried out on the same breed, or on breeding animals of the same breed that can be recruited from the breeding population of a breed society that is already carrying out a breeding programme on that breed. However, where in a Member State one or more recognised breed societies are already carrying out an approved breeding programme on a given breed, the competent authority of that Member State should, in certain specific cases, be allowed to refuse to approve a further breeding programme for the same breed, even if that breeding programme complies with all the requirements necessary for approval. One reason for refusal could be that the approval of a further breeding programme for the same breed would compromise the preservation of that breed or the genetic diversity within that breed in that Member State. The preservation of that breed might, in particular, be compromised as a result of the fragmentation of the breeding population, possibly leading to higher inbreeding, to increased incidences of observed genetic defects, to a loss in the selection potential or to reduced access of the breeders to purebred breeding animals or the germinal products thereof. Another reason for refusal could be linked to inconsistencies in the defined breed characteristics or in the main objectives of those breeding programmes. Indeed, independently of the aim of the breeding programme, namely the preservation of the breed or the improvement of the breed, the competent authority should be allowed to refuse approval for a further breeding programme in respect of the same breed where differences in the main objectives of the two breeding programmes, or in essential traits of the breed characteristics defined in those breeding programmes, would result in a loss of efficiency in terms of genetic progress in those objectives or in those traits or any correlated traits, or where an exchange of animals between both breeding populations would bear a risk of out selection or out breeding of those essential traits in the initial breeding population. Finally, in the case of an endangered breed or an autochthonous breed not commonly found in one or more of the territories of the Union, a competent authority should also be allowed to refuse the approval of a further breeding programme for the same breed on the grounds that that further breeding programme would impede the effective implementation of the existing breeding programme, in particular due to a lack of coordination, or exchange, of genealogical and zootechnical information resulting in a failure to benefit from the common evaluation of data collected on that breed. In the event of a refusal to approve a breeding programme, the competent authority should always provide a reasoned explanation to the applicants and give them the right to appeal against that refusal.</p>

               <p>The entry into the Union and the export to third countries of breeding animals and their germinal products is important for Union agriculture. The entry into the Union of breeding animals and their germinal products should therefore be carried out under conditions that are closely comparable to the rules applicable to trade in the Union. However, breeding animals and their germinal products should only be entitled to entry in the main section of a breeding book or breeding register in the Union, if the level of controls carried out in the exporting third country ensures the same certainty of pedigree details and results of performance testing and genetic evaluation as in the Union and if the breeding bodies providing those details and results are included in a list maintained by the Commission. In addition, breeding bodies in third countries should, as a matter of reciprocity, accept breeding animals and their germinal products from the respective breed society or breeding operation recognised in the Union.</p>

Annex I to that Regulation lists the CN codes for purebred breeding animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species and of bovine semen and indicates that they are exempt from the conventional rate of duties. In that case, those animals and their germinal products should be accompanied by the appropriate zootechnical certificate to support their classification as purebred breeding animals or germinal products thereof. In the case of purebred breeding animals, they should also be accompanied by a document indicating that they will be entered in a breeding book maintained by a breed society or registered in a breeding register maintained by a breeding operation.</p>

                     <p>Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/262 of 17 February 2015 laying down rules pursuant to Council Directives 90/427/EEC and 2009/156/EC as regards the methods for the identification of equidae (Equine Passport Regulation) (OJ L 59, 3.3.2015, p. 1).</p>

               <p>To ensure legal clarity and to avoid duplication, the Commission legal acts referred to in Recitals 74, 75 and 76 should be repealed from the date of application of this Regulation. In addition, the Commission should, at least 18 months before the date of application of this Regulation, adopt implementing acts laying down the model forms for the presentation of the information to be included in the list of recognised breed societies and breeding operations that is to be made public by the Member States, as well as the model forms for the zootechnical certificates for breeding animals and their germinal products. Those implementing acts should be applicable by the date of application of this Regulation.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure a smooth transition for breeders&apos; organisations, breeding organisations, breeders&apos; associations, private undertakings or other organisations or associations which have been approved or recognised with or without a limitation in time under the acts repealed by this Regulation and for the breeding programmes carried out by those operators, those operators and their breeding programmes should be deemed to be recognised or approved in accordance with this Regulation. Consequently, those operators should not be subject to the procedures for recognition, for approval and for notification of the extension of the geographical territory to other Member States set out in this Regulation, although the other provisions of this Regulation should apply to them. Member States should ensure that those operators comply with all the rules provided for in this Regulation in particular by carrying out risk-based official controls on them. In the event of non-compliance, the competent authorities should ensure that those operators take the necessary measures to remedy that non-compliance and, where necessary, suspend or withdraw the recognition of those operators or the approval of their breeding programmes.</p>

               <p>The Commission recently adopted a proposal for a new Regulation on official controls and other official activities. That new Regulation is intended to repeal Regulation (EC) No 882/2004, Council Directive 89/608/EEC<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="49">
                     <p>Council Directive 89/608/EEC of 21 November 1989 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of legislation on veterinary and zootechnical matters (OJ L 351, 2.12.1989, p. 34).</p>

                     <p>Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 29).</p>
                  </authorialNote>, and Directives 91/496/EEC and 97/78/EC. It is also intended to incorporate, with the necessary adaptations, certain of the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 and in those Directives. However, the breeding of animals is not intended to fall within the scope of that new Regulation. For legal clarity and certainty and pending the repeal of Directives 89/608/EEC, 90/425/EEC, 91/496/EEC and 97/78/EC by means of that new Regulation, it is necessary to delete the references to &apos;zootechnical&apos; from Directives 89/608/EEC and 90/425/EEC, while Directives 91/496/EEC and 97/78/EC do not require such amendment. Directives 89/608/EEC and 90/425/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
