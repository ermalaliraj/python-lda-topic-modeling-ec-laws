               <p>The flavouring substance furan-2(5H)-one (FL No 10.066) is included in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 as a flavouring substance under evaluation and for which additional scientific data was requested by the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter &apos;the Authority&apos;).

                  </authorialNote> that furan-2(5H)-one (FL No 10.066) raises a safety concern with respect to genotoxicity as it is genotoxic <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

               <p>The use of furan-2(5H)-one (FL No 10.066) therefore does not comply with the general conditions of use for flavourings set out in Article 4(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008.

In order to ensure clarity and certainty regarding the identity of the substance and to help stakeholders to properly identify this substance, it is relevant to note that further identification details of furan-2(5H)-one (FL No 10.066) provided by the Authority in its Opinion are: the CAS No. is 497-23-4, its JECFA No is 2000 and the JECFA name is 4-hydroxy-2-butenoic acid gamma lactone.</p>
