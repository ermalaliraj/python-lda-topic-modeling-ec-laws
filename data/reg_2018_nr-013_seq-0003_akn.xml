               <p>On 28 August 2015 an application was submitted for the authorisation of the use of phosphoric acid, phosphates, diphosphates, triphosphates and polyphosphates (&apos;phosphates&apos;) as a stabiliser and a humectant in frozen vertical meat spits falling under the food category 08.2 &apos;Meat preparations as defined by Regulation (EC) No 853/2004&apos; in Part E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. The application was subsequently made available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.</p>

               <num>(4)</num>
               <p>The use of phosphates is required for a partial extraction and breakdown of meat proteins to form a protein film on vertical meat spits to bond meat pieces together in order to ensure homogenous freezing and roasting. Furthermore, phosphates ensure that meat remains juicy during thawing and that vertical meat spits remain stable. Such technological need was recognised for frozen vertical rotating meat spits made of sheep, lamb, veal or beef treated with liquid seasoning or from poultry meat treated with or without liquid seasoning used alone or combined as well as sliced or minced and designed to be roasted by a food business operator. Thoroughly roasted meat strips are then consumed by the final consumer.</p>

               <p>Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission has to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health.</p>

               <num>(6)</num>
               <p>Safety of phosphates was evaluated by the Scientific Committee for Food which established the Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake of 70 mg/kg body weight expressed as phosphorus<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3">
                     <p>Reports of the Scientific Committee for Food, Twenty-fifth series, 1991, p. 13.</p>
                  </authorialNote>. Phosphates are authorised for use as food additives in a wide variety of foods including meat products and certain meat preparations. Thus it is not expected that the extension of use to frozen vertical meat spits will have a significant impact on the overall exposure to phosphates. In order to limit further exposure to added phosphates the extension of use should be restricted only to the frozen vertical meat spits for which the technological need was identified.</p>

            <recital xml:id="rec_d16e135">
               <num>(7)</num>
               <p>Since the extended use of those additives constitutes an update of the Union list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the Authority.</p>
