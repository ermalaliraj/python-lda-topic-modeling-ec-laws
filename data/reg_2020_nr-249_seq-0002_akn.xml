               <p>So far, and unless otherwise provided for in national law, the rules on access to the occupation of road transport operator do not apply to undertakings that are engaged in the occupation of road haulage operator solely by means of motor vehicles with a permissible laden mass not exceeding 3,5 tonnes or combinations of vehicles not exceeding that limit. The number of such undertakings which are active in both national and international transport operations has been increasing. As a result, several Member States have decided to apply the rules on access to the occupation of road transport operator, provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009, to those undertakings. In order to avoid possible loopholes and to ensure a minimum level of professionalisation of the sector using motor vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods and with a permissible laden mass not exceeding 3,5 tonnes by way of common rules, and thus to approximate competitive conditions between all operators, that Regulation should be amended. The requirements for access to the profession should become mandatory for operators using motor vehicles or combinations of vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods and with a permissible laden mass exceeding 2,5 tonnes but not exceeding 3,5 tonnes involved in international transport.</p>

               <p>In order to combat the phenomenon of so-called &apos;letterbox companies&apos; and to guarantee fair competition and a level playing field in the internal market, it is necessary to ensure that road transport operators established in a Member State have a real and continuous presence in that Member State and conduct their transport business from there. Therefore, and in light of experience, it is necessary to clarify and strengthen the provisions regarding the existence of an effective and stable establishment while avoiding the imposition of a disproportionate administrative burden.</p>

               <p>The real and continuous presence in the Member State of establishment should in particular require that the undertaking carries out transport operations with the appropriate technical equipment situated in that Member State.</p>

               <p>Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 requires undertakings to conduct effectively and continuously their operations with the appropriate technical equipment and facilities at an operating centre situated in the Member State of establishment, and it allows for additional requirements at national level, the most common of which being a requirement to have parking spaces available in the Member State of establishment. However, those, unevenly applied, requirements have not been sufficient to ensure a genuine link with that Member State in order to efficiently fight letterbox companies and to reduce the risk of systematic cabotage and nomadic drivers organised from an undertaking to which the vehicles do not return. Considering that, in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market in the area of transport, specific rules on the right of establishment and the provision of services may be necessary, it is appropriate to further harmonise the establishment requirements and to strengthen the requirements linked to the presence of the vehicles used by the transport operator in the Member State of establishment. Defining a clear minimum interval within which the vehicle has to return also contributes to ensuring that those vehicles can be correctly maintained with the technical equipment situated in the Member State of establishment and facilitates controls. The cycle for such returns should be synchronised with the obligation on the transport undertaking in Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="6">

This synchronisation strengthens the right of the driver to return and reduces the risk that the vehicle has to return only to fulfil this new establishment requirement. However, the requirement to return to the Member State of establishment should not require a specific number of operations to be conducted in the Member State of establishment or otherwise limit the operators&apos; possibility to provide services throughout the internal market.</p>

Experience shows that, in certain parts of the Union, that provision has been used in a systematic manner to circumvent the temporary nature of cabotage and as the basis for the continuous presence of vehicles in a Member State other than that of the establishment of the undertaking. Such unfair practices risk leading to social dumping and jeopardise respect of the legal framework relating to cabotage. It should therefore be possible for Member States to derogate from Article 4 of Directive 92/106/EEC and to apply the provisions relating to cabotage in Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 in order to address such problems by introducing a proportionate limit to the continuous presence of vehicles within their territory.</p>

               <p>Effective and efficient enforcement of the rules is a prerequisite for fair competition in the internal market. Further digitalisation of enforcement tools is essential in order to free up enforcement capacity, to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens on international transport operators and, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, to better target high-risk transport operators and to detect fraudulent practices. The means by which road transport operators can prove compliance with the rules for cabotage operations should be clarified. Roadside controls should be based on transport documents and, if available, on tachograph records. In order to simplify the provision of relevant evidence and its treatment by the competent authorities, the use and transmission of electronic transport information should be recognised as means of proving compliance. The format used for that purpose should ensure reliability and authenticity. Considering the increasing use of efficient electronic exchange of information in transport and logistics, it is important to ensure coherence in the regulatory frameworks and to establish provisions addressing the simplification of administrative procedures.</p>

               <p>In order to take into account market developments and technical progress the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission to amend Annexes I, II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 and to amend Annexes I, II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in line with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="11">
                     <p>OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1.</p>
                  </authorialNote>. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States&apos; experts, and their experts systematically have access to the Commission&apos;s expert groups meetings dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>

               <p>Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to introduce a degree of harmonisation in certain areas so far not harmonised by Union law, in particular in respect of transport with light commercial vehicles and enforcement practices, and to approximate conditions of competition and to improve enforcement, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the nature of the objectives pursued in combination with the cross-border nature of road transport, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued.</p>
