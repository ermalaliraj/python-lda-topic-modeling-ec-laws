               <p>The exceptional geographical situation of the Canary Islands in relation to the sources of supply of certain fishery products which are essential for domestic consumption entails additional costs for this sector. This natural handicap, as recognised in Article 349 of the Treaty, which results from insularity, remoteness and the outermost location of the Canary Islands, can be remedied, inter alia, by temporarily suspending customs duties on imports of the products in question from third countries within Union autonomous tariff quotas of an appropriate volume.</p>

                     <p>Council Regulation (EU) No 1412/2013 of 17 December 2013 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Union tariff quotas for imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands from 2014 to 2020 (OJ L 353, 28.12.2013, p. 1).</p>
                  </authorialNote> opened and provided for the administration of autonomous Union tariff quotas for imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020.</p>

               <p>In July 2019, the Commission submitted to the Council an examination of the impact of the measures, providing options for the period after 31 December 2020.</p>
            </recital>
            <recital xml:id="rec_d163e116">
               <num>(4)</num>
               <p>The examination showed that the utilisation rate of quotas 09.2997 and 09.2651 was significant. Under quota 09.2651, CN code 0308 was not utilised.</p>
            </recital>

               <num>(5)</num>
               <p>Tariff quotas similar to those opened by Regulation (EU) No 1412/2013 for certain fishery products are justified because they would cover the needs of the Canary Islands&apos; domestic market while ensuring that flows of duty-free imports into the Union remain predictable and clearly identifiable.</p>

               <p>Therefore, with the aim of giving a long-term perspective to economic operators to reach a level of activity which stabilises the economic and social environment of the Canary Islands, it is appropriate to extend the autonomous tariff quota regime of the Common Customs Tariff duties for an additional period for certain goods as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.</p>

               <p>In order to avoid undermining the integrity and coherence of the internal market, measures should be taken to ensure that fishery products for which suspension is granted are intended solely for the Canary Islands&apos; domestic market.</p>

               <p>Measures should be taken to ensure that the Commission is kept regularly informed of the volume of imports in question, so that, if necessary, it can take steps to prevent any speculative movement or deflection of trade.</p>

               <p>In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission allowing the Commission to temporarily withdraw the suspension in the case of a deflection of trade.
