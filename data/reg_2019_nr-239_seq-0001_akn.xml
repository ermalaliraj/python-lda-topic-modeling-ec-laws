                  </authorialNote>. The Authority concluded that no uses or import tolerances are currently authorised for fluquinconazole in the Union and no codex maximum residue limits (CXLs) are available for that active substance. Residues of ï¬‚uquinconazole are therefore not expected to occur in any plant commodity or in any animal product. As there is no risk for consumers, the MRLs for fluquinconazole should be set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 at the specific limit of determination (LOD).</p>
