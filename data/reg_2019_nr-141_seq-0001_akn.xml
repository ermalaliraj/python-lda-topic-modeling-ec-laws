               <p>The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) has the authority to adopt legally binding decisions for the conservation of fishery resources under its purview. Those decisions are essentially addressed to the NAFO Contracting Parties, but also contain obligations for the operators (for example the master of the vessel). Upon their entry into force, the NAFO conservation and enforcement measures (CEM) are binding on all NAFO Contracting Parties and, in the case of the Union, are to be incorporated into Union law to the extent to which they are not already covered by Union law.</p>
